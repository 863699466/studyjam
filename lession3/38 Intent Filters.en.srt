1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,340
正如你所看到的那样  接收器本身是很简单的
As you can see, the receiver itself is pretty

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:06,564
你在这里可以看到Extends BroadcastReceiver这个类并重写onReceive方法
simple. Extend the broadcast receiver class and override the

3
00:00:06,564 --> 00:00:09,680
接收器是轻量级的组件  是为了接收广播
onreceive handle as you can see here. Receivers are

4
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:13,520
做出反应并在五秒钟之内完成
lightweight components meant to listen for broadcasts, reacts, and complete

5
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:16,690
这五秒钟意味着简单的启动一个服务或发送一个通知完成
within five seconds that usually means simply starting a

6
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:19,350
要使你的接收器开始接受广播
service or sending a notification. To have your receiver

7
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:22,470
你可以通过类似这样的列表式接收器
start listening for broadcasts, you need to register it

8
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:25,260
来注册信息或者是像这样的
either through an entry in your manifest like this or

9
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:29,240
动态的和其他应用程序的组件在通常情况下是互动的
dynamically within another application component usually an activity,

10
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:33,080
然后你定义Intent-Filter可以选择
like this. Then you define the intent filter that

11
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:36,370
你想接收的特定的广播信息
specifies the broadcast event you want to receive.

12
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,570
你可以完成接收特定的信息通过像这里的代码这样
You can do that either here in the manifest

13
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:40,430
或者你可以注册你的带有应用程序组件例如一个Activity的接收器
or if you're registering your receiver with an

14
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:43,690
你可以像这样创建你的新的Intent-Filter
application component such as an activity, you can create

15
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:46,630
对于列表式的接收器和动态的接收器
your new intent filter like this. The biggest difference

16
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:50,460
最大的区别就是当他们在触发的时候
between manifest and dynamic receivers is when they're triggered.

17
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,880
一个经过编程的接收器会仅仅在应用程序运行的时候
A programmatically-registered receiver will only receive broadcasts while

18
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:57,890
接收广播的消息  当一个列表声明了接收器
the app is running. While a manifest declared

19
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:02,060
将会开始运行您的应用并去接收
receiver will start your app specifically to receive

20
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:05,069
特定的您的广播  举个例子
your broadcasts. For example, I usually code with

21
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:07,610
我经常在带着我的降噪耳机的时候Coding
my noise cancelling headphones on, so a music

22
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:10,160
所以一个音乐类的应用程序可能需要注册一个
app like this might want to register a runtime

23
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,710
运行时接收的系统在耳机没有插入的时候
receiver to listen to the system intent broadcast

24
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:15,590
系统应该试图去广播耳机没有插入
that announces when headphones are unplugged. That will allow

25
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:18,790
这将使它能够自动的暂停播放  当你的音频路由从耳机到外放时
it to automatically pause playback, when your audio routing switches

26
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:21,950
在这种情况下  我们可以使用
from headphone to speakers. In this case, we can use

27
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:24,750
一个在运行时的接收器  因为应用程序保证了
a runtime receiver, because the app is guaranteed to be

28
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:28,250
音乐在正常播放的时候接收器在运行  另一方面
running if music is playing. On the other hand, if I'm

29
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,790
如果我使用Google云消息从我的服务器上监听到新的数据
using Google Cloud Messaging to listen for new data from

30
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:34,730
我想要去注册一个列表式的接收器会不断的从我的服务器
my server, I want to register a manifest receiver that always listens

31
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:37,420
监听不断的传入的数据  并且它将唤醒我的程序
for incoming tickles from my server and will wake up

32
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:40,870
如果应用程序被终止触发更新应用
my app if it's being terminated to trigger the update code,

33
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:43,130
通常是一个同步适配器  这是我们将在后面的第六课
usually a sync adapter, which is something we will discuss

34
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:46,700
要讨论的内容  有非常多的广播系统可以帮助你的应用程序
later in lesson six. There's a bunch of system broadcasts

35
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,920
在系统中做出变化并及时的反应
you can monitor to help your app react to changes

36
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,880
你可以看到系统广播的动作在developer.android.com
in the system. You can see the system broadcast actions within

37
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:56,515
上面的Intent文档部分广播接收器的一大用途是
the intent documentation at developer.android.com. One great use for broadcast

38
00:01:56,515 --> 00:02:00,030
监测变化的互联网连接或者是否是在充电状态
receivers is to monitor for changes to internet connectivity or

39
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:03,230
想象一下你的应用程序需要上传一部电影
charging status. Imagine your app has to upload a movie

40
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:06,170
或计算象棋游戏中接下来的10,000步
or calculate the next 10,000 moves in a game of chess,

41
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:09,620
你如何使用一个接收器去等待设备
how might you use a receiver to wait until the device is plugged in

42
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:11,810
插入之前的启动过程  它应该是一个
before starting that process? Should it be

43
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:13,870
列表式接收器还者是广播接收器
a manifest receiver or a broadcast receiver?
