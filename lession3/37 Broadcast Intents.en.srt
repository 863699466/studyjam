We've talked about using intents within Sunshine to start activities and send

00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:11,630
many apps? For example, the system will broadcast a message, saying that the
多个应用呢?举个例子，系统要广播一个消息，说

设备正在充电或者即将重启。我们的方法是，

5
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:24,350
we use the SendBroadcast method to broadcast an intent. And those broadcasts
使用sendbroadcast的方法来广播一个指令。然后这些广播

6
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:26,900
are received by broadcast receivers, typically
就会被广播接收者接受，通常

7
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:30,430
referred to as simply, receivers. Using intent就会简明指向接受者。使用指令

8
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:34,010
filters, like the ones we saw earlier, they indicate which broadcast they're
过滤器，就像之前一样，它们会表明那些广播是自己

interested in. So if we return to our envelope metaphor from earlier, in
感兴趣的。所以如果我们反馈的是之前的封装的暗喻

10
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:43,080
the case of a broadcast intent, your
在是广播指令的情况下，你的

11

that's interested in knowing that this event has

00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:51,940
happened. And it does that using intent filter.
而它正是通过指令过滤器来实现的。

14
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:59,670
So intents, which are broadcast, are transmitted to every
所以广播指令正是通过每一个
