00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,098
我们之前说到使用在Sunshine应用中使用Intent来启动Activity并且
We've talked about using intents within Sunshine to start activities and send

2
00:00:04,098 --> 00:00:07,390
在应用间发送数据  但如果你要群发信息给
data between apps. But what if you want to broadcast a message to

3
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:11,630
多个应用呢  举个例子  系统要广播一个消息  说
many apps? For example, the system will broadcast a message, saying that the

4
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:16,180
设备正在充电或者刚刚重启完  我们的方法是
device is charging or that it's just finished rebooting. To do that ourselves,

5
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:24,350
使用sendBroadcast()方法来广播一个Intent  然后这些广播
we use the SendBroadcast method to broadcast an intent. And those broadcasts

6
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:26,900
就会被广播接收器接收到  通常
are received by broadcast receivers, typically

7
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:30,430
简称为接收器  使用Intent
referred to as simply, receivers. Using intent

8
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:34,010
过滤器  就像我们之前看到的一样  它们会表明哪些广播是自己
filters, like the ones we saw earlier, they indicate which broadcast they're

9
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:37,960
感兴趣的  所以如果我们返回到之前信封的比喻
interested in. So if we return to our envelope metaphor from earlier, in

10
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:43,080
在广播Intent的情况下  你的
the case of a broadcast intent, your

11
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:47,140
你的信封会被发送给任一
envelope is basically addressed to any broadcast receiver

12
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:49,170
对此事件感兴趣的广播接收器
that's interested in knowing that this event has

13
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:51,940
而它正是通过Intent过滤器来实现的
happened. And it does that using intent filter.

14
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:59,670
所以Intent  也就是广播  会被传送给
So intents, which are broadcast, are transmitted to every

15
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:01,980
带有特定广播接收器的应用  它们的广播接收器的
app with a broadcast receiver that has an intent

16
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:05,349
Intent过滤器会告诉系统哪些消息是它感兴趣
filter telling the system your ideas are intriguing to

17
00:01:05,349 --> 00:01:08,341
因而会为终端用户订阅这些消息
me and I wish to subscribe to end user.
