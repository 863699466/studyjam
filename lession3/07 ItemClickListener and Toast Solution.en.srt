00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,810
做完了么  我来给你演示一遍吧  正如我之前提到的
Done already? Let me show you how it's done. As I said before, we

2
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:07,640
我们要从ForecastAdapter中获取天气数据
get the forecast by calling getItem from

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:10,940
这个是我们如何显示 Toast 的代码
the forecast adapter. And here's how we actually

4
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:14,542
需要注意一下 context 上下文这个参数
display the toast. Note that the context

5
00:00:14,542 --> 00:00:17,023
可以通过 getActivity() 方法得到
is actually available through getActivity in our

6
00:00:17,023 --> 00:00:20,982
当然  如果你最后木有一个 .show() 方法
fragment. However, it won't do anything unless

7
00:00:20,982 --> 00:00:25,450
它是啥也不会显示滴喔
we also show the toast. Displaying a toast

00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:29,170
通过显示 Toast 来查看 Android 是如何执行的  这很有用
is useful to see how an Android interaction works. But this method should

9
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:33,060
这个方法未来在我们详细界面那个Activity也有用到  我们马上开讲
really be used to start our detail activity. This is what we'll do next.
