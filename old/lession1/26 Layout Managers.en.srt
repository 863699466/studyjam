00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:05,680
回到Rato所说，frame布局、linear布局、relative布局，
Going back to what Rato said, frame layout, linear layout, and relative layout

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,790
这三种布局将会是你在构建UI时最常遇见的。
are three of the most common layouts you will use in building out your UI.

3
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:13,860
这些都继承自view group类，是用来包容和排列里面的子视图（各种view）的。
These all descend from the view group class, designed to contain and

4
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:17,870
每一种布局都有各自的优势，
give order to child views. They each have their strengths and

5
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:21,080
你应该尝试学习使用他们，尽量用最简单的布局完成工作
you should always try to use this simplest layout that will get the job done.

6
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,240
Frame Layout（框架布局）非常适合简单的布局，当你只有一个子视图时，
Frame Layout is great for simple layouts when you only have one child to view,

7
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,560
例如内容区域只有列表视图的情况。
like a list view that fills the entire content area. Linear layout is

8
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:35,640
Linear Layout（线性布局）能够使子视图水平或垂直排列
perfect for stacking the views vertically or horizontally, one after another,

9
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:40,610
它也是唯一一个能够打破比例显示的布局
it is also the only way to break up the display proportionately. Relative layout

10
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:45,200
Relative Layout相较于别的布局来说更为强大，当然也更为复杂。
is powerful but a bit more complicated compared to the others. Throw a bunch of

11
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,490
你可以相对于其父元素的位置来设置其中的子元素的位置
views inside a relative layout, and then you can configure each views

12
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:53,070
也可以相对它的同级别元素的位置来设置，这就是“相对”布局
position relative to parent, the relative layout, or to sibling views, tons of

13
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:57,320
当我们构建更复杂的UI时，我们会更加详细的讨论布局。
possibilities. We'll explore these layouts in greater detail when we build more

00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:02,010
现在让我们来设计我们的天气预报列表
complex screens. For now, let's get back to building our forecast list.
