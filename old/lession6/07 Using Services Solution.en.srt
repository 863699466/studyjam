1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,900
接下来我们来看看如何实现它。
All right, you're done. Let's talk about how I

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:06,280
首先，把我们的代码
solved this one. First, let's take all our code, and

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:09,560
从FetchWeatherTask中拷贝出来
copy it from the fetch weather task. The intent

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:12,010
IntentService中会创建一个helper线程来运行这部分代码 
service actually creates a helper thread for us to run

5
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:15,300
和AsyncTask所做的工作类似。
on. Similar to what async task does. So we

6
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:18,080
我们仅需要把这部分代码从doBackground拷贝到
can just copy this stuff from doing background to on

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,240
handleIntent中即可。这里我们添加一些辅助的常量。比如LOG_TAG
handle intent. Let's add a few helpful constants, such as

8
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,550
和Intent Extra所需的String常量，
log tag and an Intent Extra, so we can pass

9
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:28,430
这样我们就能传递位置请求了。
in the location query. Now, we're just going to

10
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:30,590
现在我们仅需要整体浏览一遍代码，清除一下里面的错误即可。
go through and clean up some of the errors.

11
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:34,110
Intent Service没有返回值。
After all, Intent Service doesn't return a value. And

12
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:36,790
而且由于它是一个服务，因此它有自己的Context(上下文)
since it's a service, it has its own context.

13
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:40,933
就是这样，我们已经把我们的FetchWeatherTask变成了
And that's it. We've turned our fetch weather task

14
00:00:40,933 --> 00:00:44,750
IntentService，非常“简单粗暴”。
into an intents service, pretty straightforward. Now we just

15
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:47,200
下面我们需要调用它。在ForecastFragment的
need to call it. So, now in the update

16
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,830
updateWeather函数中，我可以通过显式Intent的方式
weather function from within forecast fragment, we can call

17
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:53,430
调用服务
the service using an explicit intent,

18
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:56,620
将所需的参数放到Intent Extra中
putting the parameter into an intent extra.

19
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:59,640
那么接下来我们看看它的运行效果
All right, let's take a look at how that runs. And when we

20
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,440
当我们点击“refresh”按钮时，它会调用我们的新服务。非常棒！
hit the refresh button, it'll use our new service. Pretty nice. And we

21
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,330
这货和我们所构思的一模一样。
really can't tell any difference, which is how we'd expect things to be.
