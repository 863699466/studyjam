1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,190
我们回到码content provider。首先
Let's go back to coding the content provider. The first

2
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:06,860
需要content provider的实现方法是
of the required content provider methods we're going to implement

3
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:10,130
gettype。gettype是用来在给定的URI里返回
is getType. getType is used to return the mime type

4
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:13,420
和数据关联的mime type。我们使用
associated with the data at the given URI. We use

5
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:16,010
之前建立的URL匹配器来匹配
the URI matcher we built earlier to match the given

6
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:22,690
我们返还一个独立的mime时间，从
we return a unique mime time, that starts with either

7
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:25,400
v和d安卓光标项目开始一个单向记录或
V and D Android cursor item, for a single record or

8
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,153
v和d安卓光标列表做一个多向项目。
V and D Android cursor dir for multiple items.

9
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:31,167
在我们的weathercontract里面我们已经很好的定义了字符串 ，在
We've nicely already defined these strings in our WeatherContract, in

10
00:00:31,167 --> 00:00:34,535
我们的测试里，我们得到了类型。现在我们要
our tests, we're getting the type. We're going to compose

11
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:37,615
在不使用weathercontract而是用我们拥有的标准方法来构建URl。
URIs, using the standard methods we have, inside of our

12
00:00:37,615 --> 00:00:41,440
然后，我们通过content resolver把
WeatherContract. Then, we're going to pass these in to

13
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,810
这些传给我们的content provider。这些便是
our content provider, through the ContentResolver. Which is how you

14
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:48,800
我们所说的content provider的所有功能。接着我们
call all functions in content provider. And we're going to

15
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,380
要确认能匹配我们的协议。
make sure it matches what we have in the contract.

16
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:54,930
我已经解释了它的实际作用所以你可以看到
I've placed the actual values as comments so you can

17
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,830
接下来将会发生的事。记录一些返还的
see, really, what's going on. Note that some of these returning

18
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:00,150
类型目录，意味着他们将会返还一个
type directory, which means they're going to return a list

19
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:03,030
列表的不同项目到他们的cursor里。当其它的在返还类型
of different items in their cursor. While others are returning type

20
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:06,020
项目时表明他们将只会返还一个单独项目。
item, which means they will only return a single item.

21
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:09,230
接下来，我们要掌握gettype。在转换声明里，
Next, we're going to have you finish up getType. You're going to add

22
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:11,970
我们要添加一个适当的方案。但返还mime类型，
the appropriate cases in this switch statement. But to return mime

23
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:16,270
剩下URl类型我们就不能掌控了。不，
types, the remaining URI types that we aren't yet handling. No,

24
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:17,960
只有俩个添加到里面但他们there are only two to add, and they

25
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,875
确实看起来像是一个一样在weather contract里。
really look just like the ones in WeatherContract.
