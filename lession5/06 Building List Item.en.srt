1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,800
为了构建我们的ui 我们来从MainActivity的
To build out our UI, let's start with the wire

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,800
框图开始  它展示了一个天气预报的列表
frame for the main activity. It displays a list of

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:10,265
每个条目保护一个图标 日期 和天气情况
forecasts, where each item contains an icon, a date, weather

4
00:00:10,265 --> 00:00:13,640
也有最高和最低温度
description; as well as high and low temperatures for that

5
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:17,320
	由于今天的天气是用户关注最高的
day. Since today's weather is probably most relevant to the

6
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:20,220
我们给了它更突出的显示相比于
user, we give more prominence to it as a list

7
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,830
另外日期的天气 我们将开始构建列表的条目在
item compared to the other days. We'll start off by

8
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:25,730
接下来的几天里 因为它是比较简单的
building the list item layout for future days because it's simpler.

9
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:29,030
然后再开始构建今天的列表条目
And then afterwards, we'll come back to do the today layout.

10
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:33,250
在当前的实现中 列表的条目xml布局是
In the current implementation, the list item forecast layout XML is

11
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:36,450
一个含有4个TextView的LinearLayout 我们也需要再修改这个布局
a horizontal linear layout of four text views. We'll need to

12
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:39,460
以达到框图要求的效果
modify the layout so that it looks like this wire frame.

13
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:41,510
我们应该一个一个来指导我们掌握了ViewGroup的几个布局
We should divide and conquer until we can use the view

14
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:44,560
的用法 你能想象一下
group layouts that we're familiar with. Can you imagine how you'd

15
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,980
来把这个ui分解成你所知道的组件吗? 
break down this UI into components that you know how to

16
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:51,840
作为一个提示 如果我在这画一些分割线呢
build? As a hint, what if I draw these separators here?

17
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,160
你能找到一个方法
Within those elements, can you find a way to

18
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,960
更近一步的进行分解用相应的ViewGroup
break it down even further with view groups you're familiar

19
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,280
你将使用到嵌套的view组 意味着view组里面有子view组
with? You'll need nested view groups, which means view groups

20
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,940
提示一下  这些数据是动态改变的
with children view groups. As a tip, this data will

21
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,740
但是你可以
be populated dynamically at run time. But you can

22
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:08,960
为了测试先写死一些值就像明天的日期或者
test it by hard coding some text values such as

23
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,420
清楚的气象条件
Tomorrow for the date or Clear for the weather condition.

24
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:16,620
对于图片 我们指定一个叫做ic_launcher的文件名
For images, we can specify a placeholder drawable called ic_launcher.

25
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:20,850
之所以这样命名 意味它是一个启动的图标 也叫做应用的
It's named this way, because it's the launcher icon, which is also

26
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:23,820
icon 这已经被包含到我们的app中了
known as the app icon. And this is already included in our

27
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:26,500
我们将得到天气的图标在之后的课程里
app. We'll be getting the rest of our weather icons for our

28
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,610
如果你想看下这个布局的样子
app later in this lesson. If you want to see what this layout

29
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:31,980
你可以点击设备窗格看一下预览
looks like, you can click on the design pane to see a

30
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:34,970
在右侧 我们看到一个树形展示了不同的view
preview of it. On the right, we see a component tree listing

31
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:37,830
我们也可以看一个给定的view的属性和值
out the different views. We can also see for a given view

32
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:41,690
我们可以改变设备的方向当你预览的时候
what the properties are, and their values. We can change the orientation

33
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:43,890
你也可以选择不同的设备就像
of the device that your previewing, you can also

34
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:47,900
Nexus 7 或Nexus系列的
select different devices such as Nexus 7, or Nexus

35
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:50,630
你也可以同时预览多个设备
10. You can also preview multiple devices at the

36
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:52,690
当你构建你的布局的时候
same time. As you build out your layout for

37
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:54,950
不要担心字体的颜色或者大小
this task, don't worry about the font color, or

38
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:58,500
或者之后的任何视觉细节
font size, or any other visual details until later.

39
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,590
当你编译并且允许后 应用应该看起来像这样
After you compile and run, the app should look

40
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:03,780
选择这个框当你完成的时候
something like this. Check this box when you're done.
