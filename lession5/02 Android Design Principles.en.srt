这些都是令人不敢相信的单方面结婚誓言，同时也是
incredibly one-sided wedding vows, and the three key principles

Android团队对这个平台和其上运行的app们
underlying the Android team's creative vision for the platform

00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:14,840
赋予的创意愿景的三大关键原则。
and the apps that run on it. As engineers,

5
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:16,860
作为工程师，人们有时很难看到
it can sometimes be difficult to see past our

00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:19,710
我们驾驭sdk的力量
own delight at harnessing the power of an sdk

7
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:22,960
驯服机器让其如我所愿时的那种喜悦，但最终，
to bend a machine to our will, but ultimately,

8
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,430
我们的目标必须是为我们的用户
our goal must be to create that same empowering experience

9
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:29,660
创造同样的感受。于是我们通过创造
for our users. And we do that by creating apps

10
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:32,320
美丽悦人，同时又强大而好用的app来做到这一点。
that are as esthetically pleasing as they are functional and

11
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,240
用户在最开始的三十秒内
easy to use. Users judge the quality of your app

12
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:38,390
就会对你的app产生评价。 这可能不公平，
within the first 30 seconds. It may not be fair,

13
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:41,480
但是不成比例的这种评价将会不仅
but a disproportionate amount of that judgement will be based

14
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,533
基于功能，而是基于视觉美感。
not on the functionality, but on the visual aesthetics. Does

15
00:00:44,533 --> 00:00:48,330
看起来有没有打磨过？看起来是否专业？
it look polished? Does it look professional? How easy is

16
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:51,800
有多容易用？不仅要看起来美美哒，整个
it to use? More than just looking pretty, the entire user

17
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:55,490
用户体验更是至关重要。因为只有30秒来户
experience is critically important. With 30 seconds to

18
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:58,505
争取用户，着陆过程变得尤为关键。
win users over, it's critical that that onboarding process

19
00:00:58,505 --> 00:01:01,520
从下载到打开你的app以显示其主要功能的过程
the time and effort required to go from downloading

20
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,420
所需要的时间和精力应当
your app to performing it's main function should be

21
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:07,800
尽可能的简短顺滑。
as short and frictionless as possible. Not only

22
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,390
不止如此，一个精心设计的app应当
that, but a well designed app should evoke a

23
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:14,530
激发潜意识的本能反应。
visceral reaction that speaks to the subconscious. It should

24
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:17,020
他应该用起来很有趣。他应当以令人愉悦的方式给予惊喜
be fun to use. It should surprise in delightful

25
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:20,590
来个小动画或者顺滑的渐变
ways through subtle animations and smooth transitions that contribute

26
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:23,890
这些都会带来强大且轻而易举的感受。
to a feeling of power and effortlessness. It should

27
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:27,000
让用户直接与物件接触交互
let users touch and interact with objects directly rather

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,490
而非不得不使用按钮和菜单。
than having to use buttons and menus. And it should

29
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:31,660
使用丰富的隐喻和图片来替代
use rich imagery and pictures in place of lots

30
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:34,370
过多的文字和长居。提供漂亮而敏感的默认项，使得用户
of words and long sentences. It allows users to

31
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:37,440
可以个性化你的app，使之变成他们自己的。
customize your app, to make it theirs while providing

32
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:41,805
创造一些如同魔法一般的东西，
beautiful and sensible defaults. Create something that works like magic,

33
00:01:41,805 --> 00:01:44,430
从设备提供的上下文习得你的偏好
learning your preference in the context provided by

34
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:47,260
于是就再也不用征询用户那些他们
the device so it never asks users for information

35
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:51,300
已经提供的信息。提供简单的快捷方式来完成
that they've already provided. Provide simple shortcuts to complete

36
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:55,460
复杂的任务，并且记住数据设置和个人定制
complex tasks, and remember data settings and customizations making

37
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:58,750
使他们可以跨设备可用。创建一个亲切并且受欢迎的体验
them available across every device. While it's good practice

38
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:01,320
是一个很好的实践。你可以通过创建与平台的样式主题相符的
to create a familiar and welcoming experience by creating

39
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,630
外观和感受来达到这一点。
a look and feel that's consistent with the platforms

40
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:06,810
同时你也要记得
styles and themes, it's just as important to remember

41
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:09,710
所有我在此讨论过的其他原则
that this, and all the other principles I've discussed

42
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:12,270
都真的只是你自己创造力的起点。
here, are really just a starting point for your

43
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:16,190
偏离这份指导方针是不提倡的，
own creative vision. Deviation from the guidelines is encouraged,

44
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:19,500
但若你真要这么干，那就带着决心偏离吧。
but when you do do so, deviate with purpose.
