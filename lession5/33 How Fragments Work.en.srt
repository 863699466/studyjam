1
00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:04,000
那么如果我们把Fragment当做迷你Activity，每一个都
So if we treat fragments as mini activities, each with

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,510
有其独立的生命周期，它和
its own independent life cycle in UI, how does that compare

3
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:10,200
真正的Activity的生命周期有什么区别呢？
to the life cycle of a real activity? Well as

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,490
正如你所期望的 基本的生命周期事件是一样的
you might expect the basic life cycle events are much the

5
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:16,140
和它的上层Activity。并且当它在切换
same as the parent activity, and as it moves through

6
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:20,288
它的生命周期，开始、恢复、暂停、停止，状态时，相同的
the cycles of starts, resumes, pauses, and stops those same life

7
00:00:20,288 --> 00:00:23,930
生命周期事件也会在Fragment当中触发。所以
cycle events will be triggered within the fragment itself. So,

8
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:26,140
在大多数情况下，你可以简单地把
in most cases, you can simply move anything that you would

9
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:29,080
本来放在Activity生命周期响应里的代码
have put into the activities life cycle handles,

10
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:32,259
移动到相对应的Fragment里面。当然，
into the corresponding fragment handles. With, of course, a

11
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:35,460
也有一些例外。与其在这onCreate里创建用户界面
couple of exceptions. Rather than building your UI here

12
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:40,990
Fragment为这个引入了一个新的特殊事件
and onCreate, fragments introduced a new event specifically for

13
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:44,260
onCreateView是用于创建或扩展
this. OnCreateView is where you construct or inflate

14
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:46,470
你的用户界面，与数据进行挂钩
your UI, hook up to any data sources, and

15
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:48,440
并且将其返回给上层的Activity。然后它就可以
return it to the parent activity, which can then

16
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:51,692
集成到它的View的层次里。相对应的
integrate it into its view hierarchy. There's a corresponding

17
00:00:51,692 --> 00:00:54,630
还有一个onDestroyView处理函数。它会在Fragment
onDestroyView handler, which is called immediately before the

18
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:57,240
刚刚被加入进back stack之前被调用，独立于
fragment is added to the back stack, independent of the

19
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:00,060
它的上层Activity。现在记住Fragment
parent activity. Now keep in mind that the fragment

20
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:04,450
管理器可以添加任意的Fragment操作，添加、移除、或替换
manager can add any fragment transactions adding, removing, or replacing

21
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:06,720
到back stack里面，通过一个上层
fragments to the back stack, with a single parent

22
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,040
Activity的动作。所以一个Fragment能过在其生命周期里
activity's actives. So a fragment can move through this

23
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,484
进行多次独立于所属Activity的状态转换
cycle multiple times independent of the host activity. So

24
00:01:13,484 --> 00:01:16,570
在onDestroyView里面，你应该清除所有的资源调用
onDestroyView is, where you should clean up any resources,

25
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:19,870
特别是与用户界面相关的，例如内存中的图片
specifically related to the UI, such as bitmaps in

26
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:23,470
数据的指标，所有这类东西来确保
memory, cursors to data, anything like that to help ensure

27
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:26,060
你的APP不会占用不必要的内存
that your app's memory footprint isn't bloated by data that's

28
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:29,950
当Fragment不可见时。现在只要
not needed when the fragment isn't visible. Now as soon

29
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:32,860
Fragment被从back stack返回，onCreateView
as the fragment is returned from the back stack, onCreate

30
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:35,360
就会被调用到，然后你可以重新创建用户界面和
view is called, and you can re-create the UI and

31
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,820
连接数据资源在你的Fragment通过生命周期
reconnect data sources before your fragment transitions through the rest

32
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,810
再次变成激活状态之前。因为
of the life cycle to become active again. And because

33
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,870
Fragment只能存在于一个Activity里
a fragment can only exist within an activity,

34
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,280
我们还需要一个呼回函数来告诉我们什么时候
we also need callbacks to tell us when a

35
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,900
一个Fragment被从它的上层Activity连接和分离。onAttach
fragment is attached and detached from its parent. OnAttach

36
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,930
是一个机会来获得它上层Activity
is your opportunity to get a reference to the

37
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:57,360
的引用地址。然而，onDetach是最后发生的一个事件
parent activity. While, onDetach is the last thing that

38
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,430
甚至在Fragment被摧毁之后
happens, even after your fragment has technically been destroyed.

39
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:03,779
现在这个难题的最后一块就是onActivityCreated
Now, the final piece of the puzzle is onActivity

40
00:02:03,779 --> 00:02:07,060
它通知我们的Fragment上层Activity
created. This notifies our fragment that the parent activity

41
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,990
已经完成了它自己的创建处理函数并且标志着
has completed its own create handler and represents the point

42
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:12,900
我们可以安全地与其UI进行交互的时间点。潜在的，
at which we can safely interact with its UI. Potentially

43
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:16,460
也包括其他Fragment。现在，就和我们在第三课讨论
including other fragments. Now, just like the activity lifecyle we

44
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:19,410
的Activity生命周期一样，一旦Fragment不再
discussed in lesson three, once the fragment is no longer

45
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:22,040
可见，它就有可能被终止而没有
visible, there's a chance it will be terminated with no

46
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:25,730
任何多余地命令被执行到。这可能在onStop之后发生，
further code being executed. That can happen, after onStop, in

47
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:28,680
如果当这个Fragment还在它所属Activity的视图层中时，
the case of the activity being terminated while the fragment

48
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,270
它所属的Activity被终止，亦或者在onDestroyView之后
is part of that activity's view hierarchy, or after onDestroy

49
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:34,360
如果这个Fragment已经被放进了
view, if the fragment has already been placed

50
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,500
back stack，当其所属Activity被摧毁时
in the back stack, once the activity is destroyed.
