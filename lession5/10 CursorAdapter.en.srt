1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,250
我们创建了todaylayout但是它为什么不显示呢？
We created the today layout so why doesn't it show

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:06,910
原因是我们现在使用的是一个简单的游标适配器。请记住
up? The reason is because we're using a simple CursorAdapter. Remember

3
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:08,960
它创建了每一行的每一列项目在
that it creates a list item for every row in the

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,740
游标里，但是它仅仅支持一种项目的显示模式。也就是说
cursor but it only supports one item view type. That means

5
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:15,970
所有行里的项目必须用同一种布局。如果
that all list items must use the same layout. If

6
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:18,640
我们希望今天的预报看上去不一样，我们就需要
we want today's forecast to look differently we're going to need

7
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,120
创建一个自定义的游标适配器。这样我们能有多种
to create a custom CursorAdapter. That way we can have multiple

8
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:25,540
多种项目的显示类型。然后我们就可以拥有多种项目布局，
item view types. Then we can have different list item layouts

9
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:28,130
取决于我们正在看的是哪一行的游标。
based on what row of the cursor we're looking at.

10
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:30,530
注意，项目显示类型适用于
Note that the concept of item view types applies to

11
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:34,280
一般而言通常的适配器，不仅仅是游标适配器。如果你打开
adapters in general, not just the CursorAdapter. If you open

12
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,730
游标适配器的说明文档，你可以知道这是一个抽象
up the documentation for CursorAdapter, you'll see that it's an abstract

13
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:40,640
类，包行两个抽象类函数需要
class. It contains two abstract methods that you'll need to

14
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,052
重载, bindView类函数和newView类函数。
override. The bindView method as well as the newView method.

15
00:00:45,052 --> 00:00:47,260
newView类函数表明如何返回一个新的列表
The newView method knows how to return a new list

16
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:50,560
项目布局，但是不包含任何数据。bindView类函数表明
item layout, but doesn't contain data yet. The bindView method knows

17
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,670
如何接收一个已存在的布局并
how to take an existing layout and update

18
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:54,660
通过游标用数据将其进行更新。
it with the data pointed to by the cursor
