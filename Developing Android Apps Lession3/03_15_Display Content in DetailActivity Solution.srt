1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,660
在fragment_detail布局中，已经定义了一个TextView
In the fragment detailed layout, a text view

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:06,160
我们必须给它指定一个id
is already defined. We have to assign it an

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,200
这样的话在DetailActivity的DetailFragment中
ID so that within the detail fragment of detail

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,120
我们就能够用findViewById()
activity we can use findViewById to

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,180
来找到这个TextView。为了取得这个TextView
find the TextView. To determine the forecast

6
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:18,150
所要展示的天气预报信息
info that the text view should display. We can

7
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:20,770
我们可以在启动DetailActivity的Intent中找到它
access the intent that the DetailActivity was launched

8
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:25,255
我们准备在onCreateView()里这么做
by. We're going to use this inside of onCreateView.

9
00:00:25,255 --> 00:00:30,565
因为我们已经向Intent的Extra添加了天气预报信息
[SOUND] Since we added an intent extra with the forecast

10
00:00:30,565 --> 00:00:35,461
所以我们可以从Intent的Extra中读取出来，把它显示出来
data there. We can read that intent extra back to display in the text

11
00:00:35,461 --> 00:00:39,289
如你所见，我们将预报信息从Intent中拉出来
view, as you can see we pulled the forecast string from the

12
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:43,840
找到rootView，然后将TextView的文字设置为预报信息
intent find our rootView and then set the text to that forecast string
