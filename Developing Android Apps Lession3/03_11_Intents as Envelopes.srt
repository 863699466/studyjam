1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:02,710
我认为可以把Intent看作信封，
I like to think of intents as envelopes

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:08,109
里边包含了一个目标，比如在这里表示你想把消息发送给哪个组件
each one includes who, or in this case, which component you want it

3
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:11,290
而且Intent里面还有空间可以
delivered to. And there's room for a small amount of data to be delivered,

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,409
以Extra的方式存储一些少量的数据
packaged as extras.

5
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:19,000
应用程序中有效的原始数据结构
Primitive tuples that will be available to the application

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,550
才能最终得到并打开这个Intent对象。
component that ultimately receives and opens this intent. So an

7
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:26,910
所以一个显式声明的Intent需要显示声明接收者的名称，
explicit intent, explicitly specifies the name of the recipient, as

8
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:29,900
就像你在这个信封上看到的一样。隐式Intent就更有意思了。
you can see on this envelope. Implicit intents are a

9
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:33,800
这里，我们并不指定这个类的名称。
lot more interesting. Here, we don't specify the name of

10
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,550
我们甚至不知道他是什么。所以，
the class. We don't even know what it is. So,

11
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:39,500
那我们如何知道需要打开哪个activity呢？
how do we indicate which activity to launch? Well, you

12
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,230
你也许知道这样的故事，你是否有时候听说过有的信用的是
know those stories you sometimes hear about letters with fake

13
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:47,890
假地址，但是依旧可以找到去往收件人地址的路线？
addresses like these that somehow still find their way to the intended

14
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,410
安卓系统的Intent解析也是一样的工作原理。
recipient? Well the intent resolution system on Android, works the same way.

15
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,940
找到一个activity，它能够执行一个你
Finding an activity, capable of performing an action

16
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,920
对相关数据的操作。所以，与其指定
you specify on the associated data. So, rather than

17
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,420
一个类名称，你要指定
specifying the name of a class, you indicate

18
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,930
一个activity要执行的操作
an action you'd like an activity to perform, and

19
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:09,000
和它对数据要进行的操作。
on what data that action should be performed.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,210
就像这样，我们想要打开一个activity，
Like this, where we want to address an activity

21
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:16,450
它能用来浏览网页。因为Intent可以
that's capable of viewing a website. And because intents

22
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:20,200
可以跨越程序进行传递，而所打开的activity
can cross through application boundaries, the activity that started,

23
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,900
很可能都不是你的应用程序的activity。所以，
may not be part of your app. So,

24
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:27,270
你可以像这样添加功能，比如浏览网页、
you can include functionality like this, browsing websites or

25
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:35,750
打电话或是从电话本里选择联系人。
making phone calls or choosing a contact from your address book. All

26
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:39,150
这些功能都可以从你的应用里打开，而你不用去实现这些功能。
from within your app, without you having to implement any of it yourself.

27
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,520
你甚至不需要知道哪个应用
You don't even need to know about the app

28
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:45,530
最终完成了你的请求。你可以在
that will ultimately service your request. You can find

29
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:47,850
安卓开发者的网站的 Common Intents 页面里了解到
details of some of the intents supported by native

30
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:50,970
原生程序所支持的intent。
