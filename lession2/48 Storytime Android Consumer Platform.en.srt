1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,130
在2013年的六月中，每天就有150万台
As of July of 2013, one and a half

2
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:07,560
新的android设备被激活
million new Android devices were being activated every day.

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,080
这在几年前是难以置信的，
So it's hard to believe that just a few

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:13,960
我开始和那些具有潜能的开发者开会并解释
years ago, I started all meetings with potential developers explaining

5
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:16,079
什么是Android然后说服他们
what Android was and convincing them that it was


6
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:19,560
现在是android的时代，我们应该在这个的平台上努力发展。
worth their time and effort developing for the platform.

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,150
到了2010年，我们甚至分享了数字
It wasn't until 2010 that we even shared numbers

8
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:26,080
去表明这个平台的成长，那就是在那一年的三月份每一天就会有10万的激活量。
to indicate the growth of the platform, 100,000 daily activations

9
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,729
在2011年中期快速增长到
in May of that year. Which quickly grew to

10
00:00:28,729 --> 00:00:33,290
500000并且在2012年的时候直接超过日激活量百万这个目标。
500,000 in mid-2011 and crossed the million daily activations mark

11
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:37,340
这就是为什么我在开始演讲的时候问房间
in 2012. That represents over a billion Android devices around

12
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:39,940
里的每一个人是不是都有一台Android设备，因此这也代表了
the world, which is why I don't start my presentations

13
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:42,320
全球超过十亿的Android设备。
asking if anyone in the room has an Android device

14
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,480
对于我来说，在那初期阶段最让我大吃一惊的就是
anymore. To me though, the biggest surprise in those early

15
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,610
要付出那么多的努力去说服这些
days was how much effort was required to convince people

16
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:52,580
为移动端开发的人们，让他们认为这是一个值得做的投资。
that developing for mobile at all was a worthwhile investment.

17
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:54,700
大部分人用他们的手机
A huge number of people use their phones to go

18
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,810
去上网，他们中的一部分则是把手机当作主要的渠道去上网。
online and many of them use their phone as the main

19
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:59,808
在2013年的皮尤互联网项目的一个研究中
way to do so. One study by the Pew Research

20
00:00:59,808 --> 00:01:04,163
发现将近三分之二的手机用户
Internet Project in 2013 found that nearly two-thirds of mobile owners

21
00:01:04,163 --> 00:01:07,111
用他们的手机上网，是2009年的两倍
use their phones to go online, double the rate found

22
00:01:07,111 --> 00:01:09,810
还有另外的三分之一的手机用户则总是
in 2009. And that a third of phone users use mostly

23
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:13,970
用他们的手机在线。沉思一下.......
their phone to get online. Think about that for a second.

24
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:17,730
这些手机将成为口袋中的电脑并且不断的连接到
These portable phones have become pocket computers constantly connected to the

25
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:20,910
云端，然后可以让我们近距离接触或者是一目了然
cloud to make the sum of human knowledge available

26
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:23,530
所有的知识。那么
to us at a touch and a glance. It's no

27
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:25,870
对于越来越多的人们来说这也不足为奇，
wonder then that for a growing number of people,

28
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:28,050
当你离开你的办公桌的时候手机就可以继续在线
mobile isn't how to get online when you're away from

29
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:31,610
这确实是取代了个人电脑，成为了他们的主要计算平台。
your desk. It's actually displacing PCs as their primary

30
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:35,460
这个改变是多么的戏剧化，这种趋势
computing platform. The change is so dramatic and the trend

31
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:39,150
也是非常明了就像谷歌公司，他就是全身心投入在因特网上，
so clear that companies like Google, who depend entirely on

32
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:42,800
还有一个手机第一政策，就是在做一个新的产品时
internet, have a mobile first policy, ensuring that the

33
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,750
移动体验是首要考虑的方面。
mobile experience is the first consideration when building

34
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:49,930
这一趋势在刚刚长大并且使用手机的年轻用户
new products. This trend is particularly evident amongst younger

35
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:52,870
中尤为明显，特别是
users who grew up using mobiles and especially

36
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:55,340
在非洲和亚洲这些新兴市场，在这些地方用
in emerging markets like Africa and Asia, where the

37
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:59,530
无处不在的宽带基础设施来支持桌面是不太现实的。
infrastructure to support ubiquitous broadband for desktops isn't

38
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:02,300
就在几年前我有幸访问肯尼亚的时候
as readily available. I saw this firsthand when I

39
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,960
我就亲眼见过这样的
had the good fortune to visit Kenya a

40
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:08,380
事情。到处都是手机和热情，可是有才的开发者
few years ago. Ubiquitous phones and passionate, talented developers

41
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:12,300
却无处可寻，然而真正打动我的是
weren't really familiar, but what really struck me was the degree

42
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,300
手机已经成为人们日常生活
to which mobile phones had become an integral part of people's

43
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,940
必不可少的一部分。他并不仅仅是用来看个邮件，或者在脸谱网上发点东西
everyday lives. It wasn't just checking email and posting to Facebook,

44
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:21,740
从杂货到车票，她还被用来（未知）购买任何东西。
it was using [UNKNOWN] to buy everything from groceries to bus

45
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:25,390
我听到的是手机是生活的一部分，
fare. Mobiles was such a part of life that I heard

46
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:28,620
而不是你对买喝的人感兴趣，
rather than buying someone a drink to show that you're interested,

47
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,440
你就给他一张电话信用卡以便他们以后如果
you'd send them a phone credit so that they can call

48
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,420
也想给你打电话的时候可以打给你。智能手机从
you if they felt the same way. In the transition of

49
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:36,890
技术附件过渡到生活的一部分的主要
smartphones from tech accessory to a part of life to the

50
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:39,180
方式就是你要通过上网来完成支付，
main way you get online to how you pay for things,

51
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:43,200
甚至是调情，这就代表着给我们这些作为开发者们的一个巨大机会。
even how you flirt, represents a huge opportunity for us as

52
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,010
那么问题来了，你将如何改变世界呢？
developers. The question is, how are you going to change the world?
