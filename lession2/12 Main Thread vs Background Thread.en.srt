1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,980
方才我们说过了  Android框架不允许我们
When we said that the framework didn't want us

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:05,080
在主线程上执行网络操作工作
to run network operations on the main thread, what

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:08,630
那什么是主线程呢  Android程序默认是
is the main thread? Well, Android apps run by

4
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:12,570
在主线程上执行的  也叫UI进程
default on the main thread, also called the UI thread.

5
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:14,900
它控制着所有用户的输入和输出
It handles all the user input as well as

6
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:18,060
比如绘制屏幕等
the output, such as screen drawing. Thus we want

7
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,760
因此我们就得避免在这里有任何耗时的操作
to avoid any time-consuming operations here, otherwise the UI

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,470
不然界面就要卡顿  让这些需要花费大量时间的工作
is going to stutter. Instead, kick off a background worker

9
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:27,430
交给后台去做
thread if you have to do some long-running

10
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:32,170
这包括网络请求  图片解码  或者  
work. This includes doing network calls, decoding bitmaps, or

11
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:35,870
读取  写入数据库
reading, and writing from the database. Okay. So, somehow,

12
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:37,890
所以  我们需要把网络请求部分的代码从主线程移走
we have to move the networking code off the

13
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:39,800
但是要怎么做才行呢
main thread. But how are we going to do

14
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,180
这里有一些选项
that? Well there are several options, but let's look

15
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:46,610
但是让我们先来回答一个问题  找到这个类的名称
for the name of the Android class that simplifies

16
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:50,520
这个类简化了后台线程的创建和UI线程的同步处理
background thread creation and UI thread synchronization, so that

17
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,370
它将在后台执行操作并把结果返回给主线程
the results from the background work will come back onto the

18
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:55,710
然后我们可以用这个结果来更新我们的用户界面
main thread, and then we can use it to update our

19
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:59,740
去网上搜索一些这个类的名称  填入下面的
UI. Search online and figure out the answer to this question

20
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:02,740
方框里吧  我有一些建议
and then enter the class name in the box. Here's some

21
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:04,950
如果你有一些问题无法从
advice for you. If you ever get stuck on how to

22
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:07,480
Android开发者网站上找到结果的话
do something in Android and you can't find it on the

23
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:12,220
你可以尝试一下stackoverflow.com这个网站
developer's site you can try to check stackoverflow.com. It's a question

24
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:16,740
这是一个对Android开发者来说非常重要的一个问答网站
and answer site that many Android developers use as a valuable resource.

25
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,700
你可能会碰到一些人问了跟你
So chances are likely that someone has

26
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,850
相同或者相近的问题
already asked a similar question that you have.
