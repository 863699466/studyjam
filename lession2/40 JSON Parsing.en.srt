00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:02,800
一旦你学习了怎样解析 JSON 数据，那么就非常
Once you've learned how to pars JSON data, it's pretty

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,990
直观地能够解析余下
straight forward to be able to pars the rest of the

3
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:07,550
我们需要的字段。因为这并不是一个Java或JSON的课程，
fields that we need. Since this isn't a course on

4
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:10,520
我们将在下面的gist中提供解析的代码。
Java or JSON, we're going to provide you with the parsing

5
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:13,210
这就是gist的样子。
code in the gist below. And this is what the

6
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:16,800
共有三个辅助方法。第一个是
gist looks like. There are three helper methods. The first is

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,280
格式化日期。第二个是四舍五入温度。第三个是
for formatting dates. The second is for rounding temperatures. The third

8
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:25,380
将forecastJsonStr转化成天气预测的数组。
is for turning a forecastJsonStr, into an array of weather forecasts.

9
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:29,780
更新FetchWeatherTask使用这些辅助方法。并且
Update the Fetch Weather Tasks to use these helpful functions. And

10
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:32,170
在doinbackground方法中应该返回一个预测的字符串数组。
the do in background method should return a string array of

11
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:35,410
你能够输出日志去检查数组是不是
forecasts. You can log the output to check that the array

12
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:38,910
正确。一天的预测的格式应该看起来像这样。
is correct. The format of one day's forecast should look like this.
