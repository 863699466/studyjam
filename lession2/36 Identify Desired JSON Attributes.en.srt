1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,360
我们合成的URL和从服务器获取的JSON字符串
The URL that we built looks good and the JSON

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,010
看上去都不错。不过这字符串还是挺长的
string from the server also looks good. However, it still is

3
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:09,840
让我们仔细看看
one long string. Let's look at it more carefully to see

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,770
我们应该从中提取什么数据
what data we should extract from it. In order to make

5
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:15,500
为了更直观地观察从服务器取回的字符串
sense of the string that comes back from the server, we

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:20,090
我们可以用JSON格式化器或者说是美化器来处理下
can put it through a JSON formatter or a JSON prettifier.

7
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:22,420
如果你用Google搜索下，你可以找到
If you Google for those terms, you'll be able to find

8
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:25,530
一些有用的工具，例如这个。我们把查询结果
a helpful tool such as this one. Here, we pasted the

9
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:28,550
粘贴到这里。然后它输出一个
result of the web query. Then, it formatted the output for

10
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:32,549
格式化过的JSON
us showing us the hierarchy of these elements. Now based on

11
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:35,200
现在，基于之前给出的Sunshine的框架图
the wireframes that you saw for the Sunshine app, can you

12
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,780
你能告诉我们这里哪些叶节点是我们所想要的吗？
tell us which of these leaf nodes we care about extracting?

13
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:41,660
虽然我们需要从父节点经过
Even though we will have to traverse through parent nodes, for

14
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:43,960
但是为了下一屏幕的小测验
the purposes of the quiz on the next screen, we're just

15
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:47,870
我们只关注这些叶节点。在下面选择你认为
looking at the leaf nodes. Make your selections below on which

16
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:51,280
我们需要在预报列表中显示的属性
attributes we'll need in order to display the list of forecasts
