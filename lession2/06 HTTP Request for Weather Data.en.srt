为了从一个应用程序中获取它的开放气象图数据，
To fetch the data from open weather map within an

00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:05,750
首先我们需要以URL的形式，
app, first we need to make an HTTP request to the

00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:09,150
向API构造一个HTTP请求。
API at the URL that we decided on earlier. Then we

00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,520
我们需要从输入流中以JSON字符串的形式读取响应。
need to read the response from the input stream to get

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:14,480
如果它没有被解析，那么我们需要检查一下是否哪里出现了问题。
a JSON string. It hasn't been parsed yet, but we'll worry

00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,080
接下来，我们需要清空断开的连接，
about that later. Then we clean up by disconnecting the connection

00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,300
并关闭一切输入流。我们也记录了我们所抓获的任何出错点。
and closing any input streams. We also log any errors that

由于这是一个庞大的网络公式化代码，
we catch. Since it's a lot of networking boiler plate code,

我们将为您提供的这些功能的代码。
