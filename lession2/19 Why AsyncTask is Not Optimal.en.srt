00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:01,800
在我们继续之前，这里我要说明下
Before we go any further, I need to

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:04,110
Catherine已经说了
jump in here. Catherine has already said that

3
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:06,410
刷新按钮只是为了debug
the refresh button is for debugging only, but

4
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:08,600
那么让我们看看这是为什么。在现实世界
let's look at why. In real life, you

5
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,720
你应该总是将刷新按钮隐藏
should always seek to eliminate the refresh button

6
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:12,970
一个好App应该像个好管家
from your app. A good app should work

7
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:16,560
在你想要什么并问出来之前就把东西给你
like a good butler, giving you what you want before you even have to ask for

8
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:19,860
it.

9
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,720
和保存按钮一样，他们都是历史遗留产物。
Much like the Save button, it's a relic of a

10
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:27,370
对于我们这些从软驱时代过来的人来说
bygone age. That's the best a reassuring safety blanket for those

11
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:30,370
这就是一个心理安慰
of us who grew up with floppy disks. With the ability

12
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:33,670
我们现在有能力运行后台任务或者直接从服务器发送信息
to run background tasks or send messages directly from the server

13
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:36,860
到我们的App，实在没有必要让用户来
to our app, there's really no reason to force users

14
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:39,960
手动运行刷新，而是应该让App自己去
to manually hit refresh. But the app is up to date

15
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,300
更新同步云端的信息
and sync with the cloud should be a given. But like

16
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:47,230
但是就像我们之前说过的，这是为了debug。所以比起输出语句
we said, this is for debugging, so like print line it's

17
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:51,370
还是加一个刷新按钮更方便。让我们来看看
acceptable for this particular purpose. Let's also take a look at

18
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:55,650
后台线程的模型，哪些选项是有潜在问题的？
our background threading model, which of the following is potential an issue?
