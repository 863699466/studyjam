1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,190
解决方法是重写AsyncTask的onPostExecute方法。
The solution is to override the onPostExecute method

2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:05,510
他在主线程中运行。
of the AsyncTask. And this runs on the main

3
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:09,410
我们获得forecast结果的字符串数组，
thread. We received the string array of forecast results,

4
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:11,590
它是从上面的background方法中作为返回值得来的。
which came as a return value from the do

5
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:15,930
首先，我们清除ForecastAdapter中所有先前的forecast数据。
in background method above. First, we clear the ForecastAdapter

6
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:19,300
然后，我们
of all the previous forecast entries. Then we go

7
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,810
向ForecastAdapter中一个一个添加新的forecast数据。
ahead and add each new forecast entry one by

8
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:25,500
这是触发
one to the ForecastAdapter. This is what ultimately triggers

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,050
listview更新的代码。注意，如果你是面向Honeycomb或更高版本的设备，
the listView to update. Note that if you're targeting Honeycomb

10
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:32,210
你在这能够使用addAll方法，
devices and above, you can use an addAll method here,

11
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:34,430
因此你不需要将他们一个一个添加。
so you don't have to add them one by one.

12
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:38,320
你能够只添加一次，并且更新listview一次。
You can just add it once and update the listView once.

13
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,060
一旦你点击refresh按钮，你将看到
Once you hit Refresh, you'll see the weather forecast for

14
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:44,700
接下来七天内你所在地区的天气预报。尽管我们点击了refresh按钮，
the next seven days for your location. Even though we hit

15
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,820
我们没有任何的verbose日志语句需要打印。
Refresh, we don't have any verbose logging statements being printed

16
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,520
我们不需要他们，因为我们现在有方法
out here. We don't need them anymore, because we have a

17
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,500
去检查我们的代码是否正确，那就是看UI。
way to check that our code is correct by looking at the UI now.
