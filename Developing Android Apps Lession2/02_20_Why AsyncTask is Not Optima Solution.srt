1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,040
那么，数据传输不在UI线程中
Well, the transfer isn't happening on the UI thread, but

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,750
但是这不是坏事。实际上，不在UI线程中
that's not a bad thing. In fact, it's good that it's

3
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:07,900
运行是一件好事。所以这儿也没问题
not happening on the UI thread. So that's not a problem

4
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:11,910
数据传输在现代智能手机App中是不可或缺的
either. Data transfers are an integral part of most modern smartphone

5
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:15,200
所以这也不是个问题。真正的问题是
apps, so that's not a problem. The real problem is that

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,080
数据传输所在的线程的生命周期被明确地绑定到
the transfer is happening on a thread whose lifetime is tied

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,800
一个UI组件上，在这里是与Activity组件绑定
explicitly to a UI component, in this case an Activity. So

8
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,330
那么当Activity组件被某些东西终止，比如旋转屏幕方向
if the Activity is terminated by something like a screen rotation,

9
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:27,080
数据传输也会被终止
the transfer will also be terminated.
