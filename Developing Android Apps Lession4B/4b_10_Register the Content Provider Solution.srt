1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,070
嗯  搞定了
Alright, you're done.

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:03,390
我们来看看这种解决方法
Let's take a look at the solution.

3
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:09,050
希望你在AndroidManifest.xml里添加了provider标签
Hopefully, you added a provider tag to the Androidmanifest.xml file to

4
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:12,695
这个标签是用来使用Content Authority注册WeatherProvider类的
register the weather provider class with the content authority.

5
00:00:12,695 --> 00:00:16,184
Authority属性需要和WeatherContract中的
The authorities attribute needs to match the content authority from

6
00:00:16,184 --> 00:00:17,685
CONTENT_AUTHORITY一致
the weather contract,

7
00:00:17,685 --> 00:00:22,205
同时name属性需要和WeatherProvider中的类名(带包路径)一致
while the name attribute needs to match the class name of your weather provider.

8
00:00:22,205 --> 00:00:25,565
注意这里你不需要提供完整的包名
Note that you don't have to specify the full package name.

9
00:00:25,565 --> 00:00:28,615
只需要额外的包路径及类名  就像我这里这样
The additional package of the class is all you need, as I did here.
