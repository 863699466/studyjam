1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:01,100
在SunShine里
In Sunshine,

2
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:05,330
我们将使用ContentProvider来帮助我们高效地从互联网同步数据
we'll using content providers to help us
efficiently sync data from the Internet.

3
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:07,890
再加上Android框架里的一些辅助功能
Combined with utilities
in the Android framework.

4
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:12,410
它还简化了与用户界面交流数据库里的内容
It also simplifies getting database
content to and from our user interface.

5
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:16,740
我们通过继承一个ContentProvider类来实现一个新的类
We implement a content provider,
by extending the content provider class.

6
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:19,890
在SunShine里，我们叫这个类WeatherProvider
In Sunshine,
we'll call this class WeatherProvider.

7
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:23,790
我们将使用这个WeatherProvider来读写我们刚创建的数据库
We'll use the weatherprovider to read
and write the database we just created.

8
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:27,540
你大概已经急于开始创建这个WeatherProvider了
You're probably excited to get started
on building our weather provider, but

9
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:30,470
但是如果你仍不确定什么是ContentProvider
if you're still unsure about
what content providers are and

10
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:34,550
它们怎么工作的，我们做了一个非常棒的演练来演示
how they work, we've built a great
exercise that demonstrates how to take

11
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:37,220
如何利用这个趠級棒的东西
advantage of all this
gnarlishious goodness.

12
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:38,370
为什么说趠級棒呢？
Why gnarlishious?

13
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:42,530
因为这个演练充分利用了UserDictionary这个Provider
Because, this exercise leverages
the user dictionary provider.

14
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:46,730
所以如果你曾想让你自己的奇怪の詞匯
So, if you ever wanted to make your
radicaloutius vocabulariousness

15
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:50,410
被你的手機倗叐所理解当学习更多关于内容Provider的
understood by your mobile friendpanion
while learning more about content

16
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:55,260
看看下面的指示，有一个额外奖励的课程链接
providers, check the instructor notes
below, for a link to the bonus lesson.

17
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:58,100
创建一个内容Provider有几个步骤
Building a content provider,
involves several steps.

18
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,440
确定你的程序需要支持的URI
Determining the URIs your
application will need to support.

19
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,543
更新这个Contract使之包括这些URI
Updating the contract
to include these URIs,

20
00:01:04,543 --> 00:01:08,599
填写一个URIMatcher，它支持所有这些URI
filling out a URIMatcher that
supports each of these URIs and

21
00:01:08,599 --> 00:01:12,907
最后实现这六个需要的Content-Provider函数
implementing the six required
content-provider functions.

22
00:01:12,907 --> 00:01:18,980
好了，现在的任务是确定URI。但是到底什么是URI？
Okay, the task is determining URIs,
but, what's a URI anyhow?

23
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:22,260
一个ContentProvider允许我们把数据和我们的View
A content provider allows us to think
of the data associated with our

24
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:26,390
联系起来通过统一资源标识符，也叫做URI。
views in terms of universal
resource identifiers or URIs.

25
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:29,180
URI的作用和它的名字表示的一样
URIs do exactly what their name implies.

26
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:33,140
它们标识一个资源。我们这里的情况是数据库里的一行数据
They identify a resource, in our
case a row, or rows, in a database.

27
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:37,710
你们几乎完全熟悉URI这个概念
You're almost certainly familiar
with the concept of a URI.

28
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:42,450
因为用作所有网页地址的URL实际上是URI的一种
Since the URL used for every web
address, is actually a type of URI.

29
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:46,530
网页这种情况，URI是被用来标识一个网页内容
In the case of the web,
it's a URI used to identify web content,

30
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:49,880
通过一个HTTP或者HTTPS格式
with an HTTP or HTTPS scheme.

31
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:56,540
在这个例子里，SunShine用URI来询问94043这个地点的天气信息
In this example, sunshine is using a URI
to query the weather for 94043 location.

32
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:59,090
我们的ContentProvider返回一个Cursor
Our content provider returns a cursor,

33
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:02,730
它包含这个URI所指的一行数据库里的数据
containing the database rows
that correspond to the URI.

34
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:05,460
通过改变这个URI询问的值
By changing the query value of the URI,

35
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:09,000
我们能让SunShine显示这个国家不同地方的天气
we can have Sunshine display weather
from different parts of the country.

36
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,280
每一个URI能包含这个Content格式
Each URI can contain the content scheme.

37
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:15,940
格式是URI的第一部分，在冒号前面
A scheme is the first part of a URI,
that precedes the colon, and

38
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:19,170
它指明这个URI将使用的协议
it identifies the protocol
that the URI will be using.

39
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:23,600
你们常看到像HTTP，FTP这样的格式在URI里
You are used to seeing schemes
such as HTTP and FTP in URIs.

40
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:27,270
“Content:”表示这个URI指向一个ContentProvider
Content colon implies that the URI
refers to a content provider.

41
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:32,920
中间这一段(Authority)，是一个唯一的字符串用来定位你的ContentProvider
A content authority, which is a unique
string used to locate your content

42
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:37,590
它应该几乎总是这个程序的包的名字
provider and it should almost always
be the package name of the application.

43
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:42,720
位置，通常指向程序里数据库的一个表
A location, which typically points to
a database table within the application.

44
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,760
最后是可选的Query，它既可以是URI路径的一部分，
And optional query, this query can
either be part of the URI path or

45
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,850
它也可以是传统URI加问号的形式
it can take the form of a traditional
URI query following a question mark.

46
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:55,230
根据目前情况，一个URI是数据的主要部分
As it turns out,
a URI is the primary piece of data,

47
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:59,580
它被传递进那些Intent。Ray已经非常好地描述过了。
that is passed in these intents that
Ray To so gloriously described.

48
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:03,080
在SunShine里，我们将充分利用这来打开详细信息界面
In Sunshine, we'll leverage
this to start the detail view,

49
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:07,075
伴随一个URI指向特定一天的天气信息
with a URI that points to the weather,
on a specific day.

50
00:03:07,075 --> 00:03:10,515
详细信息界面，用这个URI来询问WeatherProvider
The detail view, uses this URI
to query weather provider and

51
00:03:10,515 --> 00:03:12,185
并且获得正确的天气数据来显示
get the right weather data to display.

52
00:03:12,185 --> 00:03:15,495
另外，这些ContentProvider URI也被用来
Another thing that these content
provider URIs, is used for

53
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:18,822
通知用户界面某个正显示
in android is to notify the user
interface that a piece of the data it is

54
00:03:18,822 --> 00:03:19,852
的数据发送了改变
displaying has changed.

55
00:03:19,852 --> 00:03:24,132
这个代码用到了Android里一个叫ContentObserver的东西
The code registers an Android
construct called a content observer,

56
00:03:24,132 --> 00:03:28,052
来针对那个正在被显示的URI。
during our initial query,
against the URI that is being displayed.

57
00:03:28,052 --> 00:03:31,642
当运行一个数据库更新程序时，通常是在另一个线程上。
When running a database update routine,
likely on another thread.

58
00:03:31,642 --> 00:03:34,772
那个程序会告诉Android这个和这个URI相联接
That routine will tell Android that
the data associated with the URI

59
00:03:34,772 --> 00:03:36,032
的数据改变了
has changed.

60
00:03:36,032 --> 00:03:39,282
最终，这个URI应该重新读取数据库
And ultimately, that the URI
should requery the database, and

61
00:03:39,282 --> 00:03:40,742
并且刷新显示内容
refresh the display.

62
00:03:40,742 --> 00:03:44,100
这会引起界面刷新并且显示最新的数据
This will cause the display to refresh,
and show the latest data.

63
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:47,480
尽管你能看到这里，URI还没有改变
Even though as you can see here,
the URI hasn't changed.

64
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,990
内容Provider能提供各种排序的数据
Content providers,
can return all sorts of data.

65
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:53,920
但是Abstract的函数要么返回一个Cursor包含一个列表的物品
But the abstract functions return either
a cursor containing a list of items or

66
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,380
或一个单独的物品
a single item.

67
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:58,430
这些URIs怎么构建取决于不同的程序
How these URIs are structured
is up to each application.

68
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:02,290
但是Android也能帮助了把一个ID扩展成一个URI
But Android provides support, for
appending an ID to the URI path,

69
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:05,560
来指明程序想要的一个特定数据
to indicate that the application is
interested in a specific record,

70
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,320
而不是一个范围数据
rather than a range of records.

71
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:10,000
在Sunshine里，特定的日期时间
In Sunshine, the value for
a specific date and time,

72
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,550
被用来查询一个指定地址的天气
is appended to the query for
weather at a specific location.

73
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:16,470
这就需要返回一个指定的天气数据
And that causes a single
weather record to be returned.

74
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:18,870 
所以，定义URIs
So, defining URIs.

75
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:19,740
来让我们的工作变得简单吧
To make it easy for

76
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:23,360
我已经定义了这些我们将要支持的数据URIs
us, I've defined these data
URIs that we'll be supporting.

77
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,530
有一些URIs
Some of these URIs,

78
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:29,060
存在是因为某个特定的数据需要在屏幕上被显示出来
exist because the UI has a view that
needs to expose that particular data.

79
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,980
例如被用来显示天气预报主菜单
Such as weather with location,

80
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:34,380
的天气和地址
which will be used to display
the main list of forecasts.

81
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:37,410
当然还有用来显示详细天气信息的
And of course,
weather with location and date.

82
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:40,730
具体地址和时间的天气
Which would be used to display
the detailed forecast information.

83
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:45,030
其他的URIs主要被用来写入数据库，插入、更新
Others, are used primarily for writing
the database, inserts, updates and

84
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:46,190
和删除
deletes.

85
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:49,880
这些基础的URIs对于测试也是有帮助的
Having these base URIs,
is also useful for testing.

86
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:53,170
现在是时候回到我们的WeatherContract了
Now it's time to go back
to our weather contract.

87
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:56,160
我们之前描述到什么是WeatherContract的时候
When we first described
what a weather contract is,

88
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,540
我们说过那是一个数据模型，储存和界面之前的一个协议
we said that it is an agreement between
the data models, storage and views.

89
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:03,620
Presentation描述那些信息时如何被访问的
Presentation describing how
information is accessed.

90
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:06,940
原来，除了通过数据库的列名称，
It turns out,
that in addition to the column names for

91
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:11,270
这些Contract也是可以被用来定义URIs的
our database, the contract is also
a great place to define the URIs,

92
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:14,100
我们的程序会用它们来访问数据
that our application will be
using to access its data.

93
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:17,050
下面，我们会解释你需要怎么构建你的WeatherContract
Next, we'll explain what you need
to add to your weather contract.

94
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:19,890
当你完全添加这段代码进你的程序后，
When you've completed adding
this code to your project,

95
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:21,580
我会来解释你做的是什么。
I'll explain a bit
about what you've done
