1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:02,050
就是这样的
And, that's it.

2
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:04,640
我们实现了ContentProvider
We finished creating our ContentProvider.

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:09,140
既然这是个互动的环节  那我们就来说说所实现的代码
Since this has been an involved section, let's talk about what we created.

4
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:13,550
我们首先定义了ContentProvider所支持的URI
We started off by defining the URI's that our ContentProvider will support.

5
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:16,930
然后更新了合约来对应这些URI
We then updated our contract to reflect these URIs.

6
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:23,800
我们创建了一个URIMatcher  用来将URI和常量进行对应
From there, we built a URIMatcher that matches these URIs to constants we use

7
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:28,620
这些常量会在其它请求ContentProvider的函数中用在switch条件判断中
in switch statements in all of the other required content provider functions.

8
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:31,580
然后我们实现了getType方法为每个URI返回
Then we implemented the getType function to return the type of

9
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:34,060
游标（Cursor）的类型
cursor returned for each URI.

10
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:37,030
然后我们实现了ContentProvider查询函数
We then implemented the ContentProvider query functions,

11
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:41,330
紧接着实现了写操作包括插入  更新  和删除
followed by the write operations insert, update, and delete.

12
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:44,260
最后  我们聊了一下bulkInsert函数
Finally, we talked about the optional BulkInsert

13
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:48,220
它在一个单独会话中更新数据库
function to make updates to our database in a single transaction.

14
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:52,760
和多会话下更新数据库相比  这种方式运行更快  
This performs much faster, and causes less wear and tear on the flash chip,

15
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:56,310
并且能够减少闪存芯片的损耗
compared to updating the database in multiple transaction.

16
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:59,210
Android的开源世界中有很多库
There are lots of libraries out there in the Android open source

17
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:01,980
可用来创建ContentProvider
world to help you built ContentProviders.

18
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:04,935
如果你想要使用它们  你就得先知道它们
If you want to use them, you'll be able to use them now

19
00:01:04,935 --> 00:01:07,925
的工作原理  和他们的具体功能
with the confidence that you know how they work, and what they are doing.

20
00:01:09,005 --> 00:01:11,215
所以所有对数据库
So all queries and

21
00:01:11,215 --> 00:01:15,265
的请求和更新可以通过ContentProvider接口来实现
updates to the database can now be done through the ContentProvider interface.

22
00:01:15,265 --> 00:01:17,145
但是我们的代码中还没用到
But, we're still not using it in our code.

23
00:01:18,455 --> 00:01:19,075
让我们把它加上
Let's fix that.
