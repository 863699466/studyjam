1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,350
让我们继续  请看着DB helper
Let's continue looking at our DB helper.

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:06,360
我们要填充的另一个重要函数是
The other important function that we are required to fill in

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:08,290
onUpdate函数
is the onUpgrade method.

4
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:11,740
这个函数在数据库已经被创建但
This function gets called when the database has already been created but

5
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:13,740
版本发生改变时被调用
the version is changed.

6
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:18,110
版本改变或者升级意味着列  表或者
A version change or upgrade should signify that the columns, tables or

7
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:21,060
数据库的一般结构已经发生改变
general structure the database has changed.

8
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:24,744
SQLiteOpenHelper能知道database版本已经发生改变
The SQLite Open Helper knows the database version has changed because

9
00:00:24,744 --> 00:00:27,810
是因为我们传到它的构造函数里面的版本信息已经改变
the version we passed into its constructure has changed.

10
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,600
当改变数据库表的时候 
Make sure to always change the database version

11
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,460
要确保总是改变数据库的版本
when you make changes to the database tables.

12
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,570
你可能会想  我为什么要关心这个
You might think, why would I care about this?

13
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:40,590
我们没有任何更新  为啥要关心这个
I'm not upgrading anything yet, so why bother?

14
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:43,400
因为 当你改变数据库表的时候 
Because it's important to make sure that your application won't have

15
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,635
保证你的应用不发生错误非常重要
errors when you make changes to the database tables.

16
00:00:45,635 --> 00:00:50,160
由于我们要用我们的数据库来作网络数据的缓存
Since we are going to be using our database as a cache for web data, and

17
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,680
而不用于用户产生的内容  我们会删除表
not for use generated content, we'll drop the tables,

18
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,900
而这将删除所有数据
which deletes all of the data.

19
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:59,450
如果数据包括用户产生的信息  当然
If the data had contained information that was user generated, of course,

20
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:01,130
我们想要保留它
we'd want to preserve it.

21
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:05,360
为了做到这一点  我们可能通过更改表来增加新列
To do that, we'd likely use alter table to add new columns.

22
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,660
请看指导记录
See the instructor notes for

23
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:10,200
还有关于更改表方法的更多信息  如果你对实现方法很感兴趣的话
more information on alter table if you are interested in how this is done.
