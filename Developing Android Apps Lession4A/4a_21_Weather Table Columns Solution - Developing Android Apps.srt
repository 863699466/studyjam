1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,940
好吧，来看看我们是怎么做的
All right, let's see how we did.

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:08,452
如果你勾选了 记录ID，天气条件ID，最低温
If you checked record ID, weather
condition ID, minimum temperature,

3
00:00:08,452 --> 00:00:13,003
风速，湿度，最高温
wind speed, humidity,
maximum temperature,

4
00:00:13,003 --> 00:00:16,920
日期，风向还有气压，你便选对了正确的答案
date, weather direction and
pressure, you've got this right.

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,910
从技术层面上说，我们可以包含日期或者时间
Now technically,
one could have included either date or

6
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:23,040
就像时间其实包含着日期
time, as time includes date.

7
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,250
月份在这里没有多大的必要
Month doesn't really
make any sense here.

8
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:28,900
但由于我们实际只显示日期，对于数据库来说，
But since we're really displaying the
date, it makes sense for the database to

9
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:32,540
最有意义地还是尽可能多地复制那些用来显示的项
actually replicate what's on
the display as much as possible.

10
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:35,640
单位应该存储在一个独立的首选项里
Units should be stored in
a separate table with preferences.

11
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,800
我们没有任何理由去存储我们不想显示的东西，比如说
There's no reason to store things
we aren't displaying, such as,

12
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,790
你懂的，降雨量或者平均温度
you know, rainfall or
average temperature.

13
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:45,560
除此之外，我们并不能从Openweather API中获取到这些
And besides, we cannot get these
from the OpenWeatherMap API.

14
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:48,820
我们确实需要 weather condition ID，因为我们需要用它去
We do need weather condition ID,
since we use this to

15
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:52,850
显示天气预报，并确定需要显示的画面
both display the forecast, and
determine the image to display.

16
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:56,100
最后，尽管ID在我们的UI界面中不显示
And finally,
while it's not displayed in our UI,

17
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,140
我们还是需要一个ID列用来唯一地标识每一行
we need an ID column to
uniquely identify each row.

18
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,440
正如我们讨论的
As discussed, it's required for

19
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:06,410
所有的SQLite 数据库表需要显示在Android list views视图中
all SQLI database tables that are going
to be displayed in Android list views.
