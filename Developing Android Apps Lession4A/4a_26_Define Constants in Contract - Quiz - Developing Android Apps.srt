1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:02,940
现在  你已经看到为Weather表创建的WeatherEntry类
Now, that you've seen the WeatherEntry class for

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:04,560
接下来就是你的任务了
the weather table, it's your turn.

3
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:06,860
在LocationEntry内部合约类中
Add the constants for

4
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:11,850
给Location表添加一些常量
the location table in the LocationEntry inner contract class.

5
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:16,200
这些常量包括表名称以及每一列的名称
These constants included the table name, and the name of each column.

6
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,950
正如我们在之前的图表中展示的那样
As we've shown in a few previous diagrams, the columns need to store

7
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:25,010
这些列需要存储地点设置  纬度  经度以及城市名
the location setting, latitude, longitude, and the city name.

8
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:27,720
当你编写完地点实体类的代码后
After you finish coding the location entry class,

9
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,190
确保你已经看过了解决方案视频
make sure to look at the solution video.

10
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:33,760
你最好使用和我们相同的常量名  因为在编写其他类的代码的时候
You'll want to use the same constant names that we use, since the code in

11
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,280
依赖的这些常量名是相同的
the other classes you received relies on these constant names being the same.

12
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,148
一旦完成
Once you've finished,

13
00:00:39,148 --> 00:00:43,000
你就会定义完所有表的所有列名
you will have defined all of the columns for both of the tables.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,300
接着  我们就准备好使用这些列名去数据库中创建
Next, we'll be ready to use these column names to actually create the tables

15
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:47,850
我们的表
in the database.
