00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:05,240
对于Sunshine这个程序来说  这些信息只是理论上的
For the purposes of the Sunshine app, this information is purely theoretical.

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:07,700
事实上  当你需要加入一些特殊的操作  如传感监听器
In fact, you'll really only need to consider this later,

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:11,940
或者定位监听器的时候  你才真正需要考虑这个问题
when you're adding things like Sensor or LocationListeners. Until then,

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,530
到目前为止  默认的组件能帮你完成大多数操作
the default components will handle much of this behavior for

5
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:18,710
总之  你现在了解了生命周期
you. In any case, now that you understand the lifecycle and

6
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:22,110
和当系统需要资源时  它会如何让你的应用退出
the way the system handles exiting your app, when it needs its resources.

7
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:26,380
你也应该明白为什么退出或者停止键在Android应用中 其实
You should hopefully understand why Exit or Quit buttons in Android apps serve

8
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:31,020
并没有实际的意义  最多  也就是你可以通过在Activity中调用Finish函数
no practical purpose. At most, you can call finish on an activity and

9
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:35,070
让你的应用马上结束  当你点击返回键时
it will get torn down instantly. That's actually exactly what happens when

10
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:37,290
实际上表现的就是上述的行为
you use a simple hits back from within their activity.

11
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:42,035
如果你还是无法确信的话  可以打开在指导手册里的视频
If you're still not convinced, check out the video in the instructor notes.

12
00:00:42,035 --> 00:00:44,030
我在那个视频里对原因做了更加生动的讲述
Where I explain my reasoning with a little more, color.
