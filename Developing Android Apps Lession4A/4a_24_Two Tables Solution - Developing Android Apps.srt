1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,400
外键约束保证了表之间的链接
The foreign key constraint keeps the link between the tables

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:07,630
这是通过避免无效数据插入外键列来做到的
by preventing invalid data from being inserted into the foreign key column,

3
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:10,540
因为这个值必须包含在
because the value has to be one of the values contained in

4
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:12,670
表的约束值当中
the table the constraint points to.

5
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:14,750
那么这对于测试意味着什么呢
Well, what does this mean for testing?

6
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:18,990
它意味着我们不能在没有位置表的情况下测试天气表
It means that we cannot test the weather table without having the location table,

7
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:23,450
因为外键约束强制要求位置表的ID
because the foreign key constraint enforces that the location ID is a valid

8
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:25,650
在表中是一个可用的ID
ID in the location table.

9
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:28,630
这同样意味着我们必须使用插入位置表的结果
It also means that we have to use the result of an insert in the location

10
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:31,550
以便向天气表插入数据
table in order to insert in the weather table.

11
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:32,450
换句话说
In other words,

12
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:36,650
天气表不可能独立于位置表进行单元测试
the weather table cannot be unit tested independently from the location table.

13
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:39,030
我们现在就来为sunshine写一个数据库测试
We are going to be writing a database test for sunshine,

14
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:41,040
这其中就包含着一个约束
which will have to work with a constraint.
