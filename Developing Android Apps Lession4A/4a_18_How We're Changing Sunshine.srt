下面介绍构建Sunshine方式变化的概况
Here's an overview of the changes we're going to be making to Sunshine.

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:07,700
我们会跟着这张图的引导来完成我们的编码练习
We'll continue to refer to this map as we move these coding exercises.

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:11,260
这张图中有许多条目我们之前没有讨论过
There are lots of terms in this map that we haven't discussed before

4
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:15,720
例如数据库常量  内容提供者以及DB Helper
such as database contract, content provider, and DB Helper.

5
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,820
这里的每一个块都代表着一个模块化数据存储
Each one of these blocks represents a section of our modular

6
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,720
解决方案的选项
data storage solution.

7
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,560
我们从根据一个协议来定义我数据存储开始
We start by defining our data storage in terms of a contract.

8
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,850
我们一会儿将用SQLite来实现这个数据库
We then implement the database using SQLite.

9
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:32,390
最后我们在UI和数据存储之间放置一个
And finally, we layer a fundamental Android class between our UI and

10
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:35,160
叫做内容提供者的基础Android类
the data storage called a content provider.

11
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:40,100
最终  用这种方式构建数据存储可以使Sunshine
Ultimately, building our data storage in this way allows Sunshine to leverage

12
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:42,150
充分利用强大的Android框架
powerful Android frameworks.

13
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:46,270
在我们实现每一部分的时候我们将会讲解更多的详细信息
We'll explain all of this in more detail as we implement each section.

14
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:47,010
让我们现在就开始吧
Let's get started.
