1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:01,200
好
Okay.

2
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:04,590
在Dan介绍数据库之前
So before Dan gets carried away with databases, let's look at

3
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:08,280
让我们看看当你用intent在activity之间切换的时候都会发生什么
what happens when you use an intent to transition between activities.

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:09,354
在Sunshine应用中
Within Sunshine,

5
00:00:09,354 --> 00:00:13,387
如果你点击Activity列表中的一个Activity  它会打开这个更加详细的Activity
if you tap on a list in the main activity it opens up the detail activity.

6
00:00:16,962 --> 00:00:19,230
但是主Activity还是在后台运行的
But the main activity remains on the backstack.

7
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:22,080
随时都准备着重新在前台显示  只要你点一下返回键  主Activity就会重新显示
Ready to reappear as soon as you hit Back.

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,980
那么现在  在这个例子中  两个Activity在同一个应用中
Now, in that example, both activities are within the same app.

9
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,264
但是  像我们在第三节中学习的一样  你还可以使用浏览器浏览网页
But as we learned in lesson three, you can also watch the browser or

10
00:00:29,264 --> 00:00:30,507
使用Sunshine里的地图应用
maps app from sunshine.

11
00:00:35,091 --> 00:00:37,041
而且  用户可以点Home键回到主界面
Or for that matter, the user can hit Home.

12
00:00:41,065 --> 00:00:44,521
并开启其他的应用  或者点Recent键
And launch apps from there, or they can use the recent key or

13
00:00:44,521 --> 00:00:47,160
或者在通知栏中转换到其他的应用
switch to another app using notifications.

14
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,270
这些行为都意味着你可以终止在后台运行的很多应用
All of these options mean you can end up with a lot of apps on your back stack.

15
00:00:57,947 --> 00:01:02,440
一定要记住移动设备的资源是非常有限的
Now, keep in mind that our resources on devices are extremely limited.

16
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:06,700
所以让很多的应用在后台等待不是一个好办法
So it's not a good idea to have dozens of apps sitting idle in the background.

17
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:07,880
Android为我们解决了这个问题
Android solves this for us,

18
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:11,320
所以你不必使用那些令人讨厌的杀进程的应用
so you don't have to use those awful task killer apps.

19
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,010
那么  这些是怎么做到的呢
So, how does it do that?

20
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:17,120
其实是系统会杀掉那些低优先级的你目前没有在使用的应用
Well, it kills low priority applications that you haven't used in a while.

21
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:21,740
在第六节课  我们会仔细的讲解Android是如何找出哪些应用应该被杀掉的
We'll go into detail on exactly how it figures out which app needs to die, in lesson six.

22
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:25,030
现在  你只要知道你的应用
But for now, it's important to realize that your app isn't in

23
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:27,070
无法控制自己什么时候被销毁就好了
control of its own destiny.

24
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:28,612
你的应用可能在任何时间被杀死
It can be killed at any time.

25
00:01:32,589 --> 00:01:34,305
所以你要学会如何处理这种情况
So you need to know, how to deal with that.

26
00:01:34,305 --> 00:01:37,846
这就意味着你要了解Activity的生命周期
And that means understanding the lifecycle of an activity and the signals we

27
00:01:37,846 --> 00:01:41,180
和在系统中获得的表示生命周期状态的信号
get from the framework to indicate its progress through the lifetime.
