这里是创建Location表的语句的解答
Here's the solution for
the location table creation statement.

2
00:00:03,661 --> 00:00:07,553
就像我之前提到的  我们把Location Setting设置为唯一的
As I mentioned before,
we make the location setting unique.

3
00:00:07,553 --> 00:00:12,204
这非常重要  因为现存地点的ID
This is particularly important because
the ID of the existing location is

4
00:00:12,204 --> 00:00:17,700
是天气表的外键  因此必须不能更改
used as a foreign key in our weather
table, and therefore must not change.

5
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:20,590
这个约束也会限制同一个Location Setting
And this constraint will prevent
the same location setting

6
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:21,840
无法拥有多个ID
from having multiple IDs.
