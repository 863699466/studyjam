00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:04,990
作为一个应用开发者  我们有责任让自己的应用一旦被使用就深深吸引住用户
As app developers, it's our job to maintain the illusion that once started,

2
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:07,680
时刻在后台等待着用户的使用
every app is waiting patiently in the background looking for

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,670
所以  一旦用户再次把你的应用转回到前台
its chance to be the star when called on. So whenever the user switches back to

4
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:14,700
无论你的应用是否被系统临时终止
your app, whether or not the system is kilted in the interim,

5
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:18,780
都要显示出跟离开时一样的UI界面
they should be presented with the same UI they had when they left. To help,

6
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:22,540
为了帮助应用在这种情况下保存和恢复状态  Android系统提供了一对特殊的句柄
Android has a pair of handles specifically for persisting state in these

7
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:27,030
当你的应用进入不活跃状态  也就是暂停onPause状态时
circumstances. On save instance data is called immediately before on pause. So

8
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:33,450
保存实例数据的函数会被立即调用
as soon as your app is no longer active, an on

9
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:37,630
如果你的应用被系统终止
restore instance data is called immediately after on create, but

10
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:41,220
在重新创建时  恢复实例数据的函数会被立即调用
only if the app is being restarted after having been terminated by the system.

11
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:45,880
这意味着你可以读取出上次退出时  也就是这里
That means you can read the bundle of state information saved the last time your

12
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:49,870
保存的那些状态信息
app was moved to the foreground here. The next time,

13
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:52,940
即使系统终止了你的程序  下次你也可以使用这些参数
you'll use the switches to your app even if it was killed by the system in

14
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:57,520
用这个Bundle里的数据  你可以重新恢复跟上次离开时一模一样的UI
the mean time. Using that bundle you can return your ui to the same state it

15
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,040
这提供了一种不间断的效果
was the last time the user saw it creating a seamless transition that hides

16
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:05,880
并把资源管理的操作掩盖在后台  不为用户所见  原因就是这些了
the resource management happening under the covers. That's enough of the why,

17
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,910
让Dan给大家介绍一下 如何把这些理论与实际结合起来
let's go back to Dan and see how to put this theory into practice.
