1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,190
让我解释一下我看到这个布局时的
Let me the explain the reasoning that I use when I

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:05,150
推理过程。它看上去像有两个同等大小隔开的
look at a new layout. It looks like there's two equally spaced

3
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:09,120
列在这里。这表示我我们需要一个LinearLayout权重，
columns here. That signals to me we need LinearLayout weights,

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,460
其中的每一个都应该是等权的。所以我们来建立一个水平的
where each of these have equal weights. So let's create a horizontal

5
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:16,712
LinearLayout。在第一个图表里，我们有三个垂直堆叠的
LinearLayout. Within this first chart, we have three vertically stacked

6
00:00:16,712 --> 00:00:19,830
文本框，所以我们现在有一个垂直的LinearLayout。同样
text views, so we have a vertical LinearLayout, and the same

7
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:23,030
处理有第二个图表，他有两个元素垂直地互相堆叠，
goes for this second chart which has two elements vertically stacked

8
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:25,570
这意味着我们同样用一个垂直的LinearLayout。
on top of each other, which means we use a vertical LinearLayout

9
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:28,220
这里是代码，我们在layout文件夹下创建一个
as well. And here's the code, we created a

10
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:32,490
new_list_item_forecasts_today XML文件
new_list_item_forecasts_today XML file under the layout folder.

11
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:35,340
代码看上去和list_item_forecast很相似。我
The code looks very similar to list_item_forecast. I

12
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:38,540
有一个水平的LinearLayout作为根节点。第一个
has a horizontal LinearLayout, as a root element. The first

13
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:41,370
子节点是一个垂直的LinearLayout，宽度是0
child is a vertical LinearLayout with the width zero

14
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:44,970
权值是1。第二个子节点是另外一个垂直的
and a weight of one. The second child is another vertical

15
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:47,300
LinearLayout，宽度是0，权重也是
LinearLayout with a width of zero and a weight

16
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:50,600
1，这样水平的空间将会在所有子节点中间
of one, that way the horizontal space will be distributed evenly

17
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,200
平均分布。如果你退回到第一个
among each child. If you go back to the first

18
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,700
LinearLayout，注意我们有三个文本框在
LinearLayout, notice that we have three TextViews within

19
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:59,630
其中，分别是日期，最高气温，最低气温。我们指明
it,for date, high temperature, and low temperature. We specify

20
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:02,550
中心应该在水平中央，所以在这个LinearLayout的一切
gravity to be center horizontal. So anything within the LinearLayout

21
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:06,220
都会水平居中对齐。否则，按照预设，他们应该
will be centered horizontally. Otherwise, by default, they would

22
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:09,590
在LinearLayout里靠左对齐。
be left aligned to the LinearLayout. The same applies

23
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:12,270
为第二个LinearLayout做相同的设定。我们指定中心应该在
for the second LinearLayout. We specify gravity to be

24
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:15,720
水平中间，这样里面的图标和天气预报的
center horizontal so that the icon and the weather forecast

25
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,130
TextView也会水平居中。
text view within it are also centered horizontally.
