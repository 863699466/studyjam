1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,890
我们现在已经实现了两个屏幕的线框图了
Okay. So now we have the wireframes implemented for both screens.

2
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:07,080
它在平板上会是什么效果呐  额…很不幸
But what does it look like on the tablet? Well, unfortunately,

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,920
当我们把手机界面伸展到平板时
when we take the phone UI and stretch it out on

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:11,630
它就看起来不怎么好了  有太多的空白部分
a tablet, it doesn't look that great. There's a lot of empty

5
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:14,690
我们可以充分利用屏幕的优势
white space here. We could better take advantage of this screen

6
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:18,860
去向用户展示更多有用的信息  举个栗子
real estate by showing more useful information. For example, why do the

7
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:21,310
这么大个屏幕  为啥要点开才能查看详细的
details need to be a tap away when they could just

8
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:25,380
天气情况呐  此外  如果用户
as easily fit on this screen? And, furthermore, if the user wants

9
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,850
要看一下整个列表项
to look through the full list of forecasts, their eyes

10
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:32,380
他们的眼镜必须横扫着看  这是很差劲的用户体验
must go like this, which is an unpleasant reading experience. If

11
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:34,960
如果我们想让用户去读一些内容的话  我们应该把
we want the user to read some content, we should keep

12
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,340
宽度设限  那样他们就可以快速的扫描阅读
the width narrower, so that they can scan it quickly. These

13
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,080
这些属于响应式设计范畴
considerations are part of responsive

14
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,400
响应式设计是  你的应用应该在不同
design. Responsive design means designing your

15
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:45,190
分辨率大小的屏幕下保持
app by keeping in mind that it'll be used across a

16
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:48,230
相同或者相近的用户体验  这个该怎么做呢
range of different device screen sizes. But how do we do

17
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:50,540
为平板这么大的设备适配
that, and what does it mean to build for larger screen

18
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:53,700
是什么意思呢  我可以为你展示一些实际例子
devices like tablets. Well, I can show you some examples of

19
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:57,420
看看这些应用是如何使用 Muti-pane 布局适配不同屏幕的吧  在Android设计指南里
how apps adapt using multi-pane layouts. In the Android Design Guide,

20
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:01,000
有一个部分叫 Muti-pane 布局  有一项方法就是  把多个视图
there's a section on multi-pane layouts. One technique is to combine

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
结合在一起  举个栗子  在联系人这个应用里  你有
multiple views together. For example, in the People app, you have

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,800
一个联系人列表和联系人详细信息卡片
the contact list and the contact card for additional details. On

23
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,240
在平板设备上  我们可以把他们各方一边  这是
the tablet, we can put them side by side. This is

24
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,120
我们熟知的 Master/Detail Flow  这个是主列表
also known as the master detail flow. This is the master

25
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,580
这个是详细页  在设置里
list and this is the detail pane. In the settings app,

26
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:18,310
我们还有另外一个栗子  选项列的宽是根据屏幕的宽度
we have another example. The column width adjust based on the

27
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:21,430
自适应的  在日历应用里  我们有很多 panel
available screen width. In the calendar app, we have panels, and

28
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:25,170
它们在屏幕纵向的时候是垂直叠放的  
they stack vertically in the portrait orientation but horizontally in the

29
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:28,650
屏幕横向的时候是水平叠放的  这里还有其他一些个例子你可以去
landscape orientation. There also a couple of other examples that you

30
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:31,550
瞧一瞧  如果你想知道更多关于
can look through as well. If you want more information on

31
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:35,020
平板和响应式设计的话  你可以查看
designing for tablets or responsive design in general, you can check

32
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:38,140
课程视频下方的链接  在我们的系列课程里
out the links below for more details. In this course, we're

33
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,390
我们会先学习手机用户界面设计然后才是
learning how to build up the phone UI first, and then the

34
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:42,740
平板  事实情况是  当我们最初
tablet UI. But in reality, when we're designing

35
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:44,970
开始考虑它的设计的时候  就应该考虑到响应式设计
it, we thought about responsive design from day

36
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:47,010
当你自己做应用程序的时候
one. When you're building your own app, it's

37
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:49,550
千万不要把手机的用户界面设计完了
bad practice to just completely design and build

38
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:51,390
再去开始头脑风暴平板的
your phone app and then start to brainstorm

39
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:53,810
界面设计  因为平板的界面通常会被手机
about the tablet UI. That's because the tablet

40
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:55,780
界面的设计所影响
UI often has an impact on the phone

41
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:58,510
包括产品的架构等
design, as well as the architectural decisions made here.
