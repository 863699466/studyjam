1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,455
那么现在我们已经明白了Service(服务)的工作机制
So now that we understand how services work,

2
00:00:02,455 --> 00:00:06,630
下面我们来看看Android如何划分程序的优先级。
let's review how Android determines your app's priority. App

3
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:11,320
程序的优先级主要分为三种。
priority is divided into three general buckets. Critical,

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:14,370
critical(重要)、high(高)、low(低)。而程序都在各自的优先级中
high, and low. Within each bucket the apps are

5
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:16,690
按顺序进行排队。
prioritized in a queue. With the app that's

6
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:19,300
程序的优先级处在最低级并且时间最长的
been at the lowest priority for the longest, the

7
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:22,450
会第一个被运行。Critical程序是指那些活跃的程序。
first to be executed. Critical apps are those that

8
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:25,780
这些程序处在前台，正与用户发生交互行为
are active. They're in the foreground, interacting with users.

9
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:28,200
包括在前台的activity和运行在前台的service
That includes activities in the foreground and apps

10
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:32,570
属于高优先级的包括可见的activity
running foreground services. High priority apps, include any visible

11
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:35,620
和那些带有运行着的服务的程序
activities and any application with a running service.

12
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:38,760
优先级比结束前台程序、释放可见activity
While less impactful than killing a foreground app, destroying

13
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,720
或者结束服务稍低一些级别的也会通知用户
visible activities or cancelling services running tasks like

14
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:45,410
比如程序在后台进行更新。
background updates it's still going to be noticeable to users.

15
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:46,960
所以系统仅仅会在可用资源极度缺乏的时候
So, the system will only kill them in

16
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,520
才会释放他们。而处于后台的程序(他们处于优先级的最低级别)
an extreme resource crunch. Apps in the background though,

17
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,750
他们是整个程序优先级大部队中的基层干事
they're the red shirted ensigns of the app priority

18
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:55,550
任何后台程序都会根据需要被裁掉(也就是释放程序资源）
landing party. Any background app will be killed as

19
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:59,370
释放顺序是最早转到后台的程序最先被释放掉
needed, in a last seen, first killed order, in

20
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:02,610
以此来释放资源供给更高优先级的程序
order to help support the higher priority apps. I like

21
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:04,769
我喜欢把这个归结为
to think of this as the three laws of

22
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:09,250
Android资源管理的三大法则。法则一：
Android resource management. Law one, Android will keep all apps

23
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:12,480
Android会保证所有与用户进行交互的程序运行平顺。
that interact with the user running smoothly. Android will

24
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:16,190
法则二：Android会保持所有可见的activity或者正在运行的服务所占用的资源。
keep all apps with visible activities or running services running.

25
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:21,260
除非他们对资源的占用违反了法则一。法则三：Android会保持所有转入后台的程序的资源
Unless doing so violates the first law. And third, Android will keep all

26
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:23,340
除非做样做违反了
apps in the background running, unless this

27
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,990
法则一和法则二
violates the first or second laws. So

28
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:29,930
所以当你知道这些后，再来看看这几个程序。
with all of that in mind, consider these four apps. What do you

29
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:33,260
你觉得根据系统规则，他们的优先级是怎么样的呢？
think is the priority order of each of these apps, according to the system.
