1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,600
现在，一开始，当这听起来似乎是个办法的时候，我们减少每一个传输的，
Now, at first glass, reducing the payload of each transfer, and

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,330
并且只有数据传输
only transmitting data when it's required seems like a sound approach.

3
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:09,830
您减少数据的传输量，这样网络中就有更少的数据。
You're reducing the amount of data being transferred, so that's less

4
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:14,300
那样就会有更少已经完成了设备上的数据存储处理的没用的工作。
data on the network. That's less superfluous work being done storing processing

5
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:17,730
在你没有真正的
data on the device. It's basically a case of putting off

6
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:20,040
知道你需要干什么之前，基本上都耽误着所有的工作。
any work, until you actually know you need to do it.

7
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,630
但事实证明相比于之前的大cookie模式下的全部工作，
But it turns out that this approach has it's drawbacks, compared

8
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:26,220
这种方法也有他的缺点。
to the big cookie model of all of that work up front.

9
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:30,110
所以，综上所述，这个还是一个更好的解决办法。但是让我们近距离观察这个大cookie
So, overall, this is a better solution. But let's take a closer look at the big

10
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:31,670
模板。要做到这一点，我们真的
cookie model. And to do that, we really

11
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:34,360
需要理解并且以cell radio状态机为基础。
need to understand the underlying cell radio state machine.
