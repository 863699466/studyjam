1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,350
好的，完成啦。看看我们结果如何。如果你
All right, you're done. Let's look at the solution. If you

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:06,570
猜我们要把代码加入在Sunshine sync adapter的里面
guessed that we were going add this code to Sunshine sync adapter,

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:09,570
你可是再对不过了。我们就是要把代码加在那里面，
you would've been right. We're actually going to place the code right

4
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:12,720
因为这里我们知道上次我们成功的放进代码的地方。
here, because this is where we know we've done a successful insert.

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,840
所以现在要做什么呢？我们从日历这个对象
So what do we do? So we start off with the

6
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:18,370
当前的一天开始着手。然后我们在昨天的日期这个数据上
calendar object, for the current day. Then we add negative 1 to

7
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:21,770
加入一个-1的值。最后我们把数据放进
the date which means it points to yesterday. Finally, we convert

8
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:25,480
数据库里。我们再做一个请求，把所有日期小于或等于
that into a database-friendly string. And then we do a query to

9
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,270
昨天的值的都删除掉。
delete everything less than or equal to that day.

10
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:30,830
搞定，打扫卫生，清理垃圾总是好的。
Done. It's always good to clean up after yourself.
