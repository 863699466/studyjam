1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,050
回顾课程第四节，我们学习了
Back in lesson four, we learned that the

2
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:04,990
Android Runtime(运行时)会杀掉那些activity处于不可见状态的app，
 Android Runtime will kill apps with no visible activities,

3
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:07,300
来为前台的app释放需要的资源。
in order to free resources needed by the foreground

4
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:10,110
但要是你的程序中的一些任务需要在
app. But what if your app has tasks that

5
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,820
activity不可见的情况下继续执行肿么办，比如
need to continue when the activity isn't visible, things

6
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:17,150
下载文件，上传相片，或者听音乐呢？
like downloading files, uploading photos, or playing music? Well,

7
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:21,357
针对这个有一个专门的程序组件：Service(服务)。我们已经
there's an application component for that. Services. We've already

8
00:00:21,357 --> 00:00:23,224
介绍了Activities,Content Providers,
introduced Activities, Content Providers,

9
00:00:23,224 --> 00:00:25,230
Broadcast Reciviers 和intents。
Broadcast Receivers and Intents. Services,

10
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:29,500
Services是安卓应用组件整副拼图里的最后一块。
are the final piece to the Android app component

11
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:33,369
启动Service和启动activity类似
puzzle. You start services much like you do activities, by

12
00:00:33,369 --> 00:00:36,880
通过调用startService方法，并向该方法传递一个intent对象。
passing in an intent to a Start Service call.

13
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,212
停止服务也是相同的方式，通过调用
And you can stop services the same way, by calling

14
00:00:39,212 --> 00:00:40,930
stopService，并传递你想要停止的
Stop Service and passing in the name of the

15
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:44,770
服务的名字。不像activity，service没有
service you want to stop. Unlike activities, services have no

16
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:47,777
交互界面，且他们比后台进程有更高的
user interface and they run at a higher priority than

17
00:00:47,777 --> 00:00:50,490
活动优先权。这意味着当系统资源不足的时候
background activities. This means that an app with a running

18
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:52,690
程序中的后台服务
service is less likely to be killed by the run

19
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:55,620
更容易被runtime(运行时)所保留
time, in order to free resources for the foreground activities.

20
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,350
事实上，默认情况下，系统会重启
In fact, by default, the system will attempt to restart

21
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:01,180
那些在程序终止他们之前被系统所终止的服务。
services that are terminated before they are stopped from within

22
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:05,129
在这个简化的生命周期里面可以看出来。
the app. This is reflected in this simplified life cycle.

23
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:09,050
和Activities相比,Services被设计来执行
Compared to Activities, Services are designed to execute longer running

24
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:12,340
那些需要长时间运行的任务。典型地，你只需要
tasks that shouldn't be interrupted. Typically, you'll only need to

25
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:15,900
重写onStartCommand，在这里添加你后台需要运行的任务代码
override the onStartCommand handler, which is where you begin the background

26
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,860
想要执行的后台程序。但要注意的是，
task you wish to execute. But notice that there are

27
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:21,880
没有监管状态改变的处理程序来反映
no handlers for monitoring changes in state, to reflect the

28
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,600
app移动到后台进程。这是因为
app moving to the background. This is because the running

29
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,250
running service 自身发送了一个信号到框架那
service itself sends a signal to the framework that the

30
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:30,930
控制app要考虑到要比那些
containing app should be considered higher priority than other apps

31
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:34,180
在后台没有运行服务的其他app有更高的优先权。在一些
in the background that don't have running services. In some

32
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:37,150
情况下，你的service可能会执行一个任务来使那些
cases your service may performing a task, that while not

33
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:41,450
没有UI，不能被中断的进程来干扰到用户体验。
having UI, can't be interrupted without interfering with the user experience.

34
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:43,980
例如，听音乐或者汽车导航的急救。
For example, playing music or helping with in car

35
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:47,720
在这些情形里，你能指明让你的
navigation. In these cases, you can indicate that your

36
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,410
server通过开启Foreground被运行在前台。
server should be considered to be running in the

37
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:54,530
你会发现这个通知里面包含了一个通告。
foreground by calling startForeground. You'll notice that this call takes

38
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:57,330
它会被展示且不会被
in a notification. This will be displayed, and can't

39
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:59,850
解散直到服务终止，或者你
be dismissed until the service has stopped, or you

40
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:03,680
呼叫终止Foreground。稍后你将会和
call stopForeground. You'll learn more about notifications a little

41
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,600
Dan学习更多关于通告的知识。但是现在，请记住
later, with Dan. But for now, note that a foreground

42
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,440
一个前台service和一个前台activity运行起来具有相同的优先权。
service runs at the same priority as a foreground

43
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,330
这使得run time不可能
activity. Making it nearly impossible for the run time

44
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:15,800
杀掉进程来释放资源。现在，你
to kill in order to free resources. Now, you

45
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,460
自己可能会想，我要解决掉大量
may be thinking to yourself, I could save a lot

46
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:21,020
处理生命周期的麻烦，仅仅通过创建
of trouble dealing with life cycles, just by creating

47
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:24,830
long running或者甚至foreground services。嗯，我是在
long running, or even foreground services. Well, I grew up

48
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:27,260
澳大利亚沿岸长大的，所以我很早
along the coast in Australia, so I learned young

49
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:32,160
就知道逆流游泳容易疲劳而且最终是徒劳的。
that swimming against the current is exhausting and ultimately futile.

50
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,310
在这个案例里，表明要使
In this case, that means making it more difficult

51
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:37,060
系统成功管理资源是很困难的，最终很易导致
for the system to manage resources, ultimately leading to a

52
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:40,780
一个坏的用户体验。要顺流游泳。使用前台
worse user experience. Swim with the current. Use foreground

53
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:45,500
服务只在有绝对需求的情况下，
services only when and for as long as absolutely necessary,

54
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:49,020
然后尽快终止所有的服务。
and stop all services as quickly as possible. It's

55
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:52,520
记录像activity和receivers，services
also important to note that like activities and receivers, services

56
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,490
运行在主要路径上是很重要的。所以你将需要
run on the main thread. So you'll need to

57
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:57,620
使用一个后台路径或者一个思考任务来执行
use a background thread or a think task to execute

58
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:59,190
你希望要使用的服务的long runningtasks。
the long running tasks you wish to do

59
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:02,410
为了使生活更简便一些，你可以
within your service. To make life easier, you can

60
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:05,300
使用指令服务类函数。
use the intent service class. Which implements the most

61
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,920
对于使用被执行在服务里的指令来说， 这是实施最普遍的最佳实践路径。
common best practice pattern, for usi  ng intents, which are

62
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,640
它创立了一个队列
executed within a service. It creates a queue of

63
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,630
来容纳即将进入的指令，当开启服务被唤醒的时候传递进来。
incoming intents, passed in when start service is called.

64
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:17,970
然后这些会在后台路径按次序的宣告进进程，
These are then, processed sequentially on a background thread,

65
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:22,970
包括onhandleintent处理程序，和你的指令服务实施。
within the onHandleIntent handler, within your intent service implementation.

66
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:25,840
当队列是空的时候，服务器自己会终止
When the queue is empty the service self terminates

67
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,650
直到收到一个新的指令和进程再次开始。
until a new intent is received and the process begins

68
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:31,640
services是一个很有用的工具，然后理解
again. Services are a powerful tool and it's important

69
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,980
你能怎样使用他们是很重要的但在实践中
to understand how you can use them but in practice

70
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:37,290
经常有一个框架替代来转换你的
there's often a framework alternative to rolling your own

71
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:40,770
服务实施。你将会在后续的课程中学习到
service implementation. Whether that be an intent service for executing

72
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:43,810
关于是否执行后台任务和同步适配器。
background tasks or the sync adapter which you'll learn about

73
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:47,620
完美运行后台数据同步。
later in this lesson. Perfect for performing background data synchronization
