1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,910
好的，以下就是方案。开始之前，让我们
All right. And here's the solution. To start off, let's

2
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:07,010
看看我们的forecast fragment查询。由于是两张表的join，
look at our forecast fragment query. Since it's a join

3
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:09,830
添加额外参数到我们的查询中
between two tables, it's really easy for us to add

4
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:12,920
是非常简单的。现在我们确保我们保持
additional parameters to our query. Now we make sure we keep

5
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:16,390
列标一致。现在我们在抓去天气条目时，同时
the column indices consistent. Now we've grabbed the latitude and

6
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:19,270
抓取经纬度。
longitude at the same time we're grabbing our weather entries.

7
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:21,270
下一步要做的是把
The next thing to do is to move the function

8
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:25,400
在地图中打开偏好地址的方法移到ForecastFragmen里去。
open preferred location in map over to forecast fragment. Instead of

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,170
我们不使用shared preference来获取这额值，而是
using shared preferences to get these values, we can actually

10
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:30,870
从ForecastAdapter获取指针。我们
get the cursor from the forecast adapter. We can get

11
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:34,480
可以让我们的指针移到一个合理的位置，
our cursor moved to a reasonable position, and then build

12
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:39,160
然后创建经纬度冒号连接的字符串。
our new string which is just latitude colon longitude. We'll

13
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:42,320
我们会在这里注释这是啥。最后，我们
leave our comment where it was. Finally, we just have

14
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,900
只要修好代码里一些小地方
to fix up a few things in the code and

15
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:47,630
就好了。好的，至少对于代码来讲，我们依然需要
that's it. Well, at least for the code. We still

16
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:51,600
在XML里做一些事儿。让我们在选项被选中时候把R.ID.action映射
need to do some work in XML. Let's move this R.ID.action

17
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,300
移动到ForecastFragment里。
map now over to forecast fragment inside of it on

18
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,850
现在我们要做一些XML的事儿。
options item selected. And now we've got to do some

19
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:01,480
让我们看看我们的主菜单。我们只要
XML work. Let's look at our main menu. We'll just

20
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:04,620
把这个动作映射项拉过来，然后把他
pull this action map item out, and we'll place it right

21
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:08,160
放入ForecastFragment里。好的。在此还有最后一步要做的。
into forecast fragment. All right. One more thing to do

22
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,960
Raito提到的事情之一是希望
while we're here. One of the things Raito talked about was

23
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,780
去除刷新菜单项。所以
wanting to get rid of the refresh menu item. So,

24
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:17,000
让我们直接注释掉他。当我们移除刷新项时，
let's just comment it out. When we remove that action refresh

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,710
我们或许也应当从我们的源码中注释掉他。
item, we should probably comment it out from our source

26
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:22,710
最后，毕竟，你不会知道什么时候还会用到他来
code too. After all, you never know when you'll want to

27
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:25,800
debug。所以，我们完成了。我们最终的app。
use that for debugging. So, there we have it. Our

28
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:29,200
再也没有刷新按钮。
final app. No longer having a refresh button. With a

29
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,510
而是带着一个新的令人兴奋的可以关闭天气提醒的设置。
new exciting setting to turn off and on weather notifications.

30
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:35,520
细节被好好照顾到。我希望你们享受构建Sunshine。
Details are taken care of. I hope you've enjoyed building

31
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,390
还剩很多事情可以在Sunshine里做。
Sunshine. There's still lots of things left to do in

32
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:42,250
比如，我们也应当在我们的界面中加入许多聪明
Sunshine. For example, we could also add a lot more intelligent

33
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:44,710
的东西。当然还有，我们可以
things to its user interface. And of course, we

34
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:47,300
让他在同步数据上变得更加智能。
could make it a lot smarter about synching data.

35
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,730
我也希望你们从构建Sunshine的练习中所学到的
And I hope the practices you've learned building Sunshine

36
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:51,573
会对你们将来的所有app有所帮助
will help you in all of your future applications
