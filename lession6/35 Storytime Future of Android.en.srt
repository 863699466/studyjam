00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:05,360
我十二岁的时候得到了我的第一个猫（调制解调器），一个1200波特ACE兼容款。
I was 12 years old when I got my first modem, a 1200 baud ACE compatible. I

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:09,335
我开始上网，不是上因特网，而是局域网BBS。
started getting online, not the internet online, local

3
00:00:09,335 --> 00:00:12,712
与此同时，雅皮士们（中上阶层年轻专业人士）正在
BBSs. At around the same time, yuppie was supporting

4
00:00:12,712 --> 00:00:15,070
支持第一个砖头大的移动手机，因为最早的GSM网络
the first brick-sized mobile phones as the first

5
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:18,305
开始发布了。快进不到17年来到2007，
GSM network started rolling out. Fast forward less than

6
00:00:18,305 --> 00:00:22,470
iPhone面世，跟着一年不到
17 years to 2007, and the iPhone launches, followed

7
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:26,140
Android也来了。几乎是一夜之间，
less than a year by Android. And almost overnight,

8
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:28,190
我们开始期待从我们的手中获取
we've come to expect the world's information in the

9
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:31,740
世界上的信息。只是安卓问世后的六年
palm of our hands. Just six years after the first

10
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,680
时间，他正在驱动从手机到
Android phone launched, it's powering everything from phones to

11
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,740
平板，手表，电视和汽车每一件东西。所以我们
tablets, watches, TVs and cars. So where do we go

12
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:41,245
接下去会去向何方？最显而易见的是使得
next? The most obvious answer is enabling the same

13
00:00:41,245 --> 00:00:44,884
手持设备云能够链接近五十亿人。
handheld cloud connecting computing platform to the next 5 billion

14
00:00:44,884 --> 00:00:48,680
随着硬件变得越来越便宜而强大，更多的
people. As hardware becomes cheaper and more powerful, more of

15
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:52,950
世界人口会有能力获得互联网接入的电脑。
the world's population will be able to get internet-connected computers.

16
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:55,100
智能手机将会驱使这一切成为可能。
And the smartphone is going to be what makes

17
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:58,850
为了让一切更便捷，我们正在探求
it possible. To facilitate this, we're seeing new approaches

18
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:02,010
上网的新途径，网格网，白色空间，或者甚至
to getting online, mesh networks, white spaces, or even

19
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:06,610
是Google的Loon项目。我们很快就会见到全世界范围普遍存在的
Google's Project Loon. We'll hopefully soon see ubiquitous world-wide internet

20
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:10,160
网络连接变成现实。同时，智能手机
connectivity become a reality. At the same time, smartphones

21
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,490
将会开始消失。正如一旦计算机变成我们
will start to disappear. In the same way that

22
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:14,810
洗盘机，汽车或者电视的一部分时
we don't think of computers as computers once they

23
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:18,040
我们就不再把他们当作计算机了，当手机
become part of our dishwashers, cars, or TVs, we'll stop

24
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,410
消失到我们的手表和其他未知事物中去，我们也会不再把他们当作手机。
thinking of mobiles as such when they disappear into our

25
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:23,980
我们会开始期待
watches and [UNKNOWN]. We'll come to expect that anything that

26
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:26,800
能够通过无线因特网连接能改善的东西
can be improved through the incorporation of a wireless internet

27
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:30,820
都会有那么一个。为了使这发生，我们需要
connection will simply have one. For that to happen, we need

28
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:33,350
找到相比用鼠标，键盘和触摸屏，
to find more creative ways to interact with computers than

29
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:36,570
更有创造性的与计算机交互的方式。
using mouse, keyboards and touch screens. I can all ready pick

30
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:39,860
我已经可以拿起我的时候或者举起我的手腕，来找到Google，
up my phone or lift my wrist, address Google, and

31
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:43,660
做搜索，发送消息或邮件，设置定时，或者记录笔记而不需要
perform searches, send texts or email, set alarms, or take notes

32
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:46,470
触摸屏幕或者键盘。
without having to touch a screen or keyboard. Screen

33
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:49,970
屏幕正在变得过于锐利，
themselves have become so   that pixel densities aren't

34
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:52,570
像素密度已非人眼可感知的。
perceptible to the human eye. And the team at

35
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:55,630
Google X的团队正在研发可以测量血糖含量的隐形眼镜。
Google X are building contact lenses capable of measuring blood

36
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:59,420
通俗点讲，我们只是
sugar levels. Speaking of senses, not only can I

37
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:01,590
通过把手机面朝上面朝下那种来控制我们的手机，
control my phone by putting it either face up or

38
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:04,170
他有一组传感器如同军舰一般。
face down, it has a battery of sensors similar

39
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:08,530
光线感应，温度改变，气压计，
to an [UNKNOWN] class warship. Light meters, temperature changes, barometers,

40
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:10,900
陀螺仪，这些都可以用来替代
gyroscopes, all of which can be used to

41
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:15,410
文字输入或者自动处理。可穿戴设备，汽车，
replace text entry or automate processes. Wearables, cars,

42
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:18,780
以及温度调节器为传感器引入了更多的可能性。
and thermostats introduce even more possibilities of sensors.

43
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,850
把这一切都接入云端，
Connect all of that to the cloud, and the

44
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:24,460
可能性是无穷无尽的。Android的未来
possibilities are endless. Future of Android isn't a

45
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:27,420
不是一台更强大的手机处理系统。
more powerful phone operating system. It is the

46
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:31,410
这会是不可见的，无处不在的，云计算背后的大脑。
brains behind invisible, ubiquitous, cloud connected computing. So

47
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:33,620
所以我们今天用来学习构建酷炫应用的技能
the skills we learn today to build cool apps

48
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,810
也会是我们将来
are the same skills we'll use tomorrow

49
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:38,620
控制周遭一切时所使用的。我们已经
to control everything around us. We've taken

50
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:42,300
向未来迈出了第一步。我已经迫不及待看到你们接下去会做的了。
the first step into that future. I can't wait to see what you do next.
