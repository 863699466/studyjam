1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,350
所以，现在我们有一个简单的服务，不是么？
So, now, we have a simple service. Wasn't that easy?

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:08,140
但是他仍然不能激活他自己。幸运的是，这有一个专门
But it still doesn't wake itself up. Fortunately, there's a system

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:11,430
为他准备的系统服务。这刚好是引入AlarmManager的好机会。
service for that. This is a good opportunity to introduce

4
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:15,020
AlarmManager允许你通知系统，让系统知道你想用它
the AlarmManager. The AlarmManager allows you to tell the system that

5
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:17,220
来激活一个你应用程序的组件，
you want it to wake a component of your application

6
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,690
并且在后台做一些处理。
up after a period of time and do some processing in

7
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:22,370
你甚至可以偶尔用它来激活
the background. You can even have it wake up your

8
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:26,780
你的应用程序。但是，我们是怎么在后台激活的呢？
application periodically but, what do we wake up in the background?

9
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:28,810
这将是一个Android组件，在他被叫做
That would be an Android component we haven't

10
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:32,940
Broadcast Receiver之前，我们是从来都没有见过的。Broadcast Receiver
seen before called a Broadcast Receiver. A Broadcast Receiver

11
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:34,770
是一个特殊类，它经常被用来
is a special class, that is used to

12
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:39,270
接收来自其他应用程序的intent broadcast。一个
receive intent broadcast often from other applications. Typically a

13
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:42,020
broadcast receiver将会象征性的为这些broadcaast记录一个intent filter
broadcast receiver will register an intent filter for

14
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:45,690
这也是一种应用程序监听警报的一种方法。
these broadcasts. It's also one way the application will

15
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:48,980
所以让我们添加一些alarm stuff吧。
listen in on alarms. So let's add some alarm

16
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:52,530
首先，我们要添加一个Broadcast Receiver
stuff. First, I'm going to add a Broadcast Receiver

17
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:56,100
作为Sunshine服务的一个静态内部类。
as a static inner class of Sunshine Service.

18
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,760
但他成为一个Android组件之后，我们要在
Since this is an Android component, I'll register

19
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:02,540
菜单里记录这个Broadcast Receiver。注意
this Broadcast Receiver in the manifest. Note the

20
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:06,770
在这种方式下静态内部类是以符号出现的。好的，
way a static inner class is notated. Okay, I've

21
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:09,080
我已经把Broadcast Receiver的核心部分给你了，
given you the bones of a broadcast receiver

22
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,180
这样就可以控制一个alarm了，但是现在
that can handle an alarm, but now it's

23
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:14,770
轮到你了。你可以从已经明确的意图中新建一个PendingIntent
your turn. You can create a PendingIntent from

24
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:17,840
让alarm manager激活你的broadcast receiver。
an explicit intent to have the alarm manager activate

25
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,390
我建议你先随便给设置个短警报，比方说5秒，
your broadcast receiver. I recommend setting the alarm to something absurdly

26
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:26,030
这样你就可以很轻松地测试他的工作状态了。
short, like five seconds, so you can easily test that it's working.
