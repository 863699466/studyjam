1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,510
对于像我一样习惯于使用桌面窗口开发的人来说
A platform which terminates apps on its own is a pretty radical departure for

2
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:07,920
平台自己终止应用是一个很大的改变
anyone like me who cut their teeth on desktop Winforms development.

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,910
如果你有相似的开发背景
If you come from a similar background you probably have

4
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:14,912
你很可能已经能很好的理解生命周期的事件处理是用来干什么的了
a pretty good idea of what to expect in terms of lifecycle event handles.

5
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:24,380
你通过onCreate函数创建你的用户界面
You start with the onCreate call back where you build and wire up your UI.

6
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:28,910
一旦界面被创建好  你的Activity也就随之被创建成功了  不难理解 
to you that there are also event handlers for when the activity becomes visible.

7
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:32,650
当Activity能够被看见的时候  会有事件被触发
Once that's done, your activity has been created. It likely won't be a surprise

8
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:36,970
这个就是开始onStart过程  另一个是  当被切换到这个Activity  处于前台运行状态的时候
Which is onStart and another for when it gets focus and becomes the active

9
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:42,255
此时是恢复onResume过程  当结束的时候  过程是反过来的
[SOUND] onPause indicates that the activity has lost focus, followed by

10
00:00:42,255 --> 00:00:48,542
暂停onPause过程表示Activity失去了焦点  然后接下来
foreground app, which is onResume. That same sequence, then happens in reverse.

11
00:00:48,542 --> 00:00:54,283
是停止onStop过程  此时Activity就不可见了  最后是销毁onDestroy过程
onStop when the app is no longer visible. Finally, there's an onDestroy method,

12
00:00:54,283 --> 00:00:58,540
生命周期结束  当你的应用程序第一次启动时
indicating the end of the app lifecycle. When your app is first launched, you'll

13
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:03,265
你会非常快速的经历建立onCreate开始  onStart恢复  onResume这三个过程
quickly move through these states. Create, Start, Resume, one after the other

14
00:01:06,803 --> 00:01:10,985
但是  在这个应用程序的生命周期中  从程序调用创建onCreate
But within the full application lifetime, from when onCreate is first called and

15
00:01:10,985 --> 00:01:16,480
到最后程序结束  Activity的活跃生命周期和
till the app is finally terminated. It will move through the active lifetime and

16
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:22,640
可视生命周期过程会反复调用很多次  让我们仔细的分析一下
the physical lifetime, many times. Let's look at those in a little more detail.
