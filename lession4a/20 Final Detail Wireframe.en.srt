1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,110
现在我们再来重新回顾一下详细的框图
This is a good time to revisit our final detailed wire frame.

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:08,160
对于每次天气预报  我们至少要保存日期
For each weather forecast, we're going to need to store at least the date,

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,710
天气状况  最高温度  最低温度
the condition, the high and low temperature,

4
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:17,130
湿度  风向  风速  气压
the humidity. The wind speed and direction, and the barometric pressure.

5
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:22,380
在数据库中  我们用行来表示一次预报
Since our database will use row to represent each forecast day, we'll store

6
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:26,100
所以上述的每一项都被存在不同的列中
each piece of data associated with the forecast in a separate column.
