00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,520
你完成任务了  希望你不要介意我这次给你的表的
All right, you're done. I hope you don't mind that I gave you

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:07,010
数据比较多  但是起决定作用的是第一个数据  所以如果我按照其它顺序给你这些数据
the larger table this time. But it depends on the first one, so it would've been

3
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:11,510
也是没有关系的  根据我提供的ContentValues对象的结构
hard to give you in any other order. I gave you the content value structure, so

4
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:15,820
只插入数据是非常简单的  然后  我们再查询数据
it's pretty easy to just insert the data. Then, we query the data back out.

5
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:19,811
如果moveToFirst()方法失败了  cursor对象是空的
[SOUND] If moveToFirst() fails, the cursor is empty, and

6
00:00:19,811 --> 00:00:24,258
查询也就失败了  这里有很多的剪切复制工作  使用helper对象从数据库查询数据
the query failed. [LAUGH] Lots of cut and paste here. It is nice to fetch the DB

7
00:00:24,258 --> 00:00:28,606
是非常好的方法  我们的测试并不是必须的
values using the helper for the data type, although its not strictly necessary,

8
00:00:28,606 --> 00:00:32,759
因为我们知道这个测试肯定会得到预期的结果
since we know our test data is actually going to match our constrains. And

9
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:36,430
另外我们需要在这里添加一种失败的情况  如果我们的查询没有得到任何结果
there is one more failure case we need to add here, if our query doesn't return

10
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:41,920
就像这样  上面的工作就是为了创建一个数据库
any rows. And that's it. All that just to get a database and

11
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,790
并对它进行测试  现在让我们再运行一下测试程序
a way to test it. Now let's run the test again. Well, at

12
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:51,140
至少我们知道了所有的这些基本的东西都可以正常运行  记住了  如果没有这些测试
least we know all the basic stuff works, and just remember, without these tests,

13
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:54,440
你可能隔很长时间才能运行一次你的代码
you wouldn't have been able to run this code for a very, very long time.
