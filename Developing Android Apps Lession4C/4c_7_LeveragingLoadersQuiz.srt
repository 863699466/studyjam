1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,378
好吧  该你了
All right, it's your turn.

2
00:00:02,378 --> 00:00:05,100
在ForecastFragment里实现一个CursorLoader
Implement a CursorLoader in the forecast fragment

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:08,390
用来在cursorAdapter里读取cursor
to load the cursor used in the cursor adapter.

4
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:12,020
当数据发生改变的时候  loader会负责发起重新请求  
You want to pass zero in for the flags when you create the cursor adapter as

5
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:16,270
所以当你创建cursoradapter时  要将flag设置为0
the loader will now be responsible for re-querying when data changes.

6
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:19,050
而且  这是在ForecastFragment中实现
Also, it's easiest to have ForcastFragment

7
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:21,060
Loader回调最简单的方法
implement the Loader Callbacks.

8
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:22,495
如果完成了这些以后
If after you're doing all of this,

9
00:00:22,495 --> 00:00:26,440
你的程序能够显示天气信息  那么你的实现方法就对了
your app still displays the weather, you've probably done it right.

10
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:29,990
要确定引用到了这里所有类所需的Android
Make sure to check that you are using the support library versions of all of

11
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:31,320
支持库
our classes.

12
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,210
否则  你的程序讲无法兼容Android 2.3
Otherwise, you won't get Android 2.3 compatibility.

13
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:38,260
在下面的指导笔记中我已经给出了
I've provided the exact import statements you need to use

14
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:39,750
确切的导入声明
in the instructor notes below.
