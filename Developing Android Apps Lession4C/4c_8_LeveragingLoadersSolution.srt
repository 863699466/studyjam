1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,029
不错！  搞定！
Alright, you're done.

2
00:00:02,029 --> 00:00:03,370
我们来看一眼我的解决方法
Let's take a look at my solution.

3
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:09,160
第一步  我们创建一个整型常量作为loader ID
For our first step, we created a loader ID integer constant.

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:12,890
在activity里使用的时候要保证这些常量是唯一的
These just have to be unique for every loader you're using in your activity.

5
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:16,465
然后我们按照CursorLoader的需求在ForecastFragment中
Then we had forecast fragment implement the loader manager loader

6
00:00:16,465 --> 00:00:20,920
实现了LoaderManager.LoaderCallbacks  数据类型为Cursor  
callbacks with type cursor, as required by CursorLoader.

7
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,448
我们这里加上了三个LoaderCallbacks的接口方法
We added our three loader callback functions.

8
00:00:24,448 --> 00:00:28,570
对于onCreateLoader  我们将用于创建cursor的ContentProvider的请求
For on CreateLoader we move the ContentProvider query we had for

9
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:33,330
放进来  然后用它来初始化CursorLoader
creating the cursor, and use this to initialize the CursorLoader.

10
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:34,420
在onLoadFinish
In onLoadFinish,

11
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:39,070
我们将ForecastAdapter的cursor和新的cursor交换
we swap the cursor in our ForcastAdapter with our new loaded one.

12
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:44,500
在onLoaderReset  我们会释放之前所用的资源
In onLoader reset, we want to release any resources that we might be using.

13
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,680
就这样
And that's it.

14
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,870
运行一下  保证一切功能正常
Let's run this, and make sure it's all working correctly.

15
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:51,740
正如你看到的  屏幕上显示一些天气信息
And, as you can see, some fabulous weather.

16
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:56,970
虽然看上去和上一章节我们实现的效果完全一样  但是
This is actually using the loader, even though it looks exactly like the output

17
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:59,030
这里的确是用的是loader
from the last section that we completed.
