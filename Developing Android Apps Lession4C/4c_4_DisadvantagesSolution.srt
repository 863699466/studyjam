1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,760
早期的Android版本中并没有CursorLoader
Early versions of Android
don't have cursor loaders.

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:07,960
相反，当ContentProvider的数据发生改变时
Instead, the cursor adapter requeried
the database on the main UI thread,

3
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:10,650
CursorAdapter在UI主线程中请求数据库
when data from a content
provider changed.

4
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:14,090
它会造成很多应用程序的屏幕出现卡顿（显示帧率会下降）
This caused frame rate
drops in many applications.

5
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:16,280
所以第一个答案毫无疑问是肯定有弊端的。
The first answer is a definite yes.

6
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:21,220
我们关注了AsyncTasks之类的元素如何与UI线程进行绑定。
We noted how things like async
tasks are bound to the UI.

7
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:23,700
所以很小的一些变化，比如屏幕旋转，
So something as little
as an orientation change

8
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:27,160
会造成activity停止直到请求完成。
could cause the query to complete
after the activity stops.

9
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,350
因此另一个答案也是肯定的。
So that's another definite yes.

10
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:33,080
cursor与activity进行绑定也意味着
The cursor being tied to the activity
also means that the data would

11
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:37,040
当屏幕发生旋转时数据也要被重新读取，
generally have to be requeried
when the screen rotates, so

12
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:40,110
所以这样做肯定是有弊端的。
there are definitely disadvantages.
