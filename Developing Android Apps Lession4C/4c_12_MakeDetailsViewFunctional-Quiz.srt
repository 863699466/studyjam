00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:01,340
OK
Okay.

2
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:03,350
这次的作业有点大
Now for the big quiz.

3
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:06,990
在预报细节界面中使用CursorLoader
Implement the details view
using a CursorLoader.

4
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:10,240
我们刚刚在ForecastFragment中使用了CursorLoader

如果你不确定从哪儿开始的话
So if you're unsure where to start,

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,940
照着ForecastFragment的步骤做
forecast fragment.

00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:17,143
别忘了使用projection
Consider taking

8
00:00:18,043 --> 00:00:22,051
有点复杂的部分是要确保完成时
The trickiest part of all this is
making sure that your sharing function

9
00:00:22,051 --> 00:00:24,087
你的分享功能还能正常运行
is still working when you're all done.

10
00:00:24,087 --> 00:00:26,179
不过别太担心
But don't worry too much about that.

11
00:00:26,179 --> 00:00:30,088
重要的是要理解CursorLoader是怎么工作的
The important thing is to
understand how CursorLoaders work.

12
00:00:30,088 --> 00:00:32,093
如果你真的不清楚分享部分是怎么做的
If you're at all confused
about how sharing is done,

13
00:00:32,093 --> 00:00:34,937
