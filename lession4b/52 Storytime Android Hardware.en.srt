Nexus 1在我心里一直有非常特别的位置

00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,970
我的第一台android设备，HTC G1
to take anything away from my first Android device, the

下巴和滑出式键盘。

Motorola Droid的发布功不可没

它也是Verizon在美国发布的设备，

真正开始了Android激活的洪水

21
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:04,910
Droid是一台只支持CDMA的电话
was a CDMA only phone, so it was never

22
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:08,050
所以我从没有真正的用过它

23
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:12,320
然后就是Nexus One,代号为激情

吸引了二万多个Android开发者

从motorola zoom开始，android进军平板，
Zoom, which led Android's official expansion into tablets, and leading the

37
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,960
它也为nexus 7和nexus 10指引着道路。
