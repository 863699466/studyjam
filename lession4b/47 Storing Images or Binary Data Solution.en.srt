00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,230
让我们来讨论讨论  说真的  这个是根据你的数据大小
Let's talk about this. Honestly, it really depends on

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:07,210
来决定的  对于储存量小的
the size of your data. For small amounts of

3
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:11,310
二进制数据  那些小到不用操心的那种
binary data, very, very small amounts of binary data,

4
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:13,070
你只需要把原始数据放进
you could actually put the raw data in the

5
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:15,770
数据库  有一小部分的数据是这样类型的  而且这些数据的储存
database. There are blob types and those are supported

6
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:18,900
功能工作的很好  当然了  如果你打算把
and work pretty well. However, as you start putting

7
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,230
大一点的数据放进数据库  这种原始数据储存就不实用了
larger data into the database, it gets pretty inefficient.

8
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,860
你就不得不写一大堆程序来解决这个问题
And you end up writing a lot more code.

9
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,430
当然  只要是把数据储存在设备的公共文件夹
Well, as far as storing the files in a public folder

10
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:30,420
这些都要考虑以上问题  当然  上述的方法还是可以解决问题的  只要
on the device is concerned, well, that might work if you

11
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,640
你想把文件分享出去  但是  事实上  你不想让这些文件跟
actually wanted to share those files. But, typically, you don't want to

12
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,360
别的应用的文件混在一起  所以把这些文件放在公共
share those files with other applications. So, storing them in a

13
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:40,580
文件夹是一个坏主意  除此之外  第三个
public folder on the device isn't a very good idea. But

14
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:43,580
选择其实也挺好  把这些文件储存在一个
the third option is pretty good. Storing the files in a

15
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:47,950
私人的文件夹同时在参照一个数据库中的地址  这是 
private folder and then referencing the location in the database. Now,

16
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:50,720
无可厚非的  你就不需要把温泉全部放在数据库了
admittedly, you might not even need to put them into the database

17
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:53,510
  不过这通常值得去做如果
at all. But it's often nice to do this if

18
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:55,520
你需要做一系列的查询  你
you need to do any kind of queries on them. You

19
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,140
可以把元始数据储存在数据库并且储存在
can store metadata in the database and store files in

20
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,850
私有文件夹  这就是安卓gallery文件廊如何工作的
a private folder. This is what Android does in the gallery.
