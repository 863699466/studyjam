00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,230
Let's talk about this. Honestly, it really depends on
让我们来讨论讨论，说真的，这个是根据你的数据大小
2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:07,210
the size of your data. For small amounts of
来决定的。 对于储存量小的
3
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:11,310
binary data, very, very small amounts of binary data,
二进制数据，那些小到不用操心的那种，
4
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:13,070
you could actually put the raw data in the
你只需要把原始数据放进
5
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:15,770
database. There are blob types and those are supported
数据库。有一小部分的数据是这样类型的，而且这些数据的储存
6
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:18,900
and work pretty well. However, as you start putting
功能工作的很好。当然了，如果你打算把
7
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,230
larger data into the database, it gets pretty inefficient.
大一点的数据放进数据库，这种原始数据储存就不实用了。
8
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,860
And you end up writing a lot more code.
你就不得不写一大堆程序来解决这个问题。 
9
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,430
Well, as far as storing the files in a public folder
当然，只要是把数据储存在设备的公共文件夹
10
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:30,420
on the device is concerned, well, that might work if you
这些都要考虑以上问题，当然，上述的方法还是可以解决问题的，只要
11
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,640
actually wanted to share those files. But, typically, you don't want to
你想把文件分享出去。 但是，事实上，你不想让这些文件跟
12
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,360
share those files with other applications. So, storing them in a
别的应用的文件混在一起。 所以把这些文件放在公共
13
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:40,580
public folder on the device isn't a very good idea. But
文件夹是一个坏主意。除此之外，第三个
14
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:43,580
the third option is pretty good. Storing the files in a
选择其实也挺好。 把这些文件储存在一个
15
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:47,950
private folder and then referencing the location in the database. Now,
私人的文件夹同时在参照一个数据库中的地址。这时，
16
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:50,720
admittedly, you might not even need to put them into the database
无可厚非的，你就不需要把温泉全部放在数据库了
17
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:53,510
at all. But it's often nice to do this if
。不过这通常值得去做如果
18
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:55,520
you need to do any kind of queries on them. You
你需要做一系列的查询。你
19
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,140
can store metadata in the database and store files in
可以把元始数据储存在数据库并且储存在
20
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,850
a private folder. This is what Android does in the gallery.
私有文件夹。这就是安卓gallery(文件廊)如何工作的
