1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,540
很好，你完成了。我们来看看答案
Alright, you're done. Lets take a look at the solution.

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:06,380
现在我们需要一些TextViews。首先
Now we're going to need some text views. First of all lets

3
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:09,430
让我们看看LinearLayout。这是垂直的。我们希望它是
look at our linear layout. It's vertical. We're going to want it

4
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:11,930
水平的。接下来我们需要
to be horizontal. The next thing we're going to want are a

5
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:15,580
很多TextViews。把它们拖进来就好。
bunch of text views. Lets just drag them in. Now

6
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:18,330
在上一个测试里我们创建了一些ID
remember we had all those ID's that were given to us

7
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:22,980
第一个是list_item_date_textview
in the last quiz. The first one is the list_item_date_textview

8
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,730
我们会写一些文字
And we'll give it some text that makes

9
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:28,350
这会帮助我们创建这个界面
sense when we help to layout the layout. We'll remove

10
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:31,890
我们会在真正提交前删掉这些文字的
this before we actually submit it to our project. And

11
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:35,960
我们可以把屏幕横过来玩玩。这会看起来
for fun let's switch to landscape. It'll make things a

12
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:39,910
更清晰些。然后我们再放大一点点
little more legible. Also let's just zoom in a little bit.

13
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:46,490
很好，这就是我们的list_item_date_textview。接下来
All right. So that's our list item date text view. Now

14
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:52,490
我们需要另一个TextView。因为我们想要外观设计保持一致
right next to that, we want another text view. Since we want the design to be

15
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:57,550
这一个不需要一个ID。如果你还记得
the same, this one doesn't need to have an ID. If you remember our

16
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:02,880
我们的设计是一个日期，接着一个短横线，
design had the date. Followed by a dash, followed

17
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:07,530
接着是预测温度，然后是一个短横线，然后是最高温度
by the forecast, followed by a dash, followed by the high,

18
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:11,860
和最低温度中间被斜线隔开。所以这个TextView只需要
followed by a slash, followed by low. So this is just going to be a view that

19
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:19,900
有一条短横线。我们甚至可以暂时把它写死在程序里。然后我们
contains a dash. And we can even hardcode this in. For now, then we're going to

20
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,400
要在旁边创建另一个TextView
create another text view next to that. Our

21
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,560
这个地方会显示一个天气预报，比如Clear
placeholder text will be a forecast, like clear.

22
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,888
这个的ID是list_item_forecast_textview
The ID for this will be list item

23
00:01:27,888 --> 00:01:33,820
现在我们需要另外一个TextView
forecast text view. Now we need another text view.

24
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:37,740
再说一次，这个TextView不需要ID，因为用不着。
Once again this one's not going to have an ID, because we don't need it. And

25
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:41,040
然后加上另一条短横线。现在我们开始做
we'll add another dash. Now we're actually getting

26
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,060
最高和最低温度。假设
to the high and low forecasts. Let's say

27
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:49,520
最高温度23.接着是一个画斜线的TextView，
a high of 23. One more plain text view, this one with a slash and, once

28
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,660
不需要ID.最高温度的ID
again, with no ID. And for our high

29
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:58,960
最好是list_item_high_textview。最后我们再加
forecast, it better be list_item_high_textview. Finally, we'll add one

30
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,060
一个空白的TextView。这一个是用来显示
more plain text view. This one will be for

31
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:04,360
最低温度的。很明显，它的ID是
our low, and of course, that means it's going to

32
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:10,639
list_item_low_textview。这就是我们做的多个TextView
be list_item_low_textview. And there we have it. Our multiple text

33
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,180
的界面。我们可能会想把它做得更漂亮点
view layout. Now we might want to make this prettier.

34
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:15,600
但是这是一个很好的开始，并且刚好具备了
But this is a good start and it just plays

35
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,730
我们要求的四个部分。它们全都是
the four fields that we asked for. They are all

36
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:20,920
LinearLayout的一部分。在我们提交这个代码前
part of a linear layout. Before we actually would submit

37
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:24,470
删除掉所有的备注信息，除了
this, lets remove the placeholder tabs for everything except for,

38
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:27,900
这些静态文字。我们还要删除掉这些空ID，
the static fields. We'll also have to remove these empty IDs, its

39
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:31,440
实际上这对于帮助我们理解这些TextView是很重要的。
actually important to understand whats going on in these text views. And there

40
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,430
删完了，这就是你的界面看起来应该有的样子。至少如果你
we have it, that's what your layout should look like, At least if you

41
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:38,150
希望它看起来和我们刚开始看到的一样
want to make it look almost identical to the layout we started out

42
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:40,680
当然你可以自由发挥
with. Of course you can go wild with these designs, and there's

43
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,810
用这个界面编辑器和各种不同的Layout，你可以做很多事情
a lot you can do with the layout editor and with different kinds

44
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:46,740
我们会在下一节课学到更多。好了
of layouts. We'll be learning more about that in the next lesson. Alright,

45
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:49,540
我们终于开始跟用户体验联系起来了。让我们
we finally get to start hooking this up to our UX. Let's go

46
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:50,800
回到ForecaseFragment
back to forecast fragment.
