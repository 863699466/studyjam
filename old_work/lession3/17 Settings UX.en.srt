00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,420
我们来看看设置界面画的线框图
Let's go through the wire frames for the settings UI.

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:07,010
在DetailActivity中的溢出项目菜单（overflow menu），有一个设置选项
Within the detail activity in the overflow menu, there's a settings menu item.

3
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:10,970
当你单击这个设置选项，会打开一个SettingsActivity
When you tap on the setting's menu item, it opens up the SettingsActivity.

4
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:15,800
如果你单击LOCATION(地点)项，会弹出一个对话框，你可以向这里面填入邮编
If you tap of location, it pops up a dialog, where you can enter in your

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:20,320
用你最习惯的方式去输入地点
postal code. Feel free to use your preferred method for inputting location,

6
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,970
比如说输一个城市名。只需确保从服务器端返回的数据
such as city name. Just verify that the data coming back from the server is for

7
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:29,420
是你所期望的。注意对这里的字符串输入是没有检验的
the location you expect. Note that there's no validation on this string input.

8
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:33,528
如果你想让这个App成为一个成品App，你应该在这里做一些对错误输入的处理
If you're trying to make this app a production app, you would want some kind of

9
00:00:33,528 --> 00:00:39,070
如果你单击“PICK YOUR UNIT”(单位），会打开一个对话框
error handling here. If you tap on pick your units, it opens up a dialogue

10
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:42,820
你可以从中选择一个在这个APP里的温度按公制单位或英制单位显示
where you can choose to display temperature within the app as wither metric or

11
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:46,640
这里的话就是摄氏和华氏
imperial units. This is basically just Celsius or Fahrenheit, and

12
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,280
这就是SettingsActivity所做的。记住，你不会想将所有东西
that is what this SettingsActivity does. Remember that you don't want to make

13
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,570
都来个设置选项。如果你和组员一起讨论一个特性
everything a setting. If you're discussing a feature with a teammate and you

14
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:58,010
并且不知道怎么办才好，不要折衷地将它做成一个用户设置选项
can't decide on something, don't compromise by just making it a user setting.

15
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:02,180
有很多经验都表明，现在做一个艰难的产品决定会对用户比较好
There are instances where making a difficult product decision now will be better

16
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:06,050
因为这样用户就不需要担心不知道该设置什么值
for the user, because then they won't have the burden of having to decide what

17
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:10,020
并且记住，总是有下一次App升级的机会
the value of the setting should be. And remember, there's always an opportunity

18
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:14,490
去往里面添加新功能，所以要三思熟虑。如果你一开始就加了
in an app update to add the setting later. If you add it to begin with, it's

19
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:18,090
想再去掉某些设置是很困难的，因为那时候会激起有些用户的愤怒
infinitely harder to take away the setting because some users might get angry

20
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:22,210
如果你在决定是否应该添加一个设置项上犹豫不决
with you. If you're having trouble deciding if something should be a setting or

21
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:25,765
你可以看一下安卓设计指南中的“设置”小节
not, you can check out the setting section in the Android design guide,

22
00:01:25,765 --> 00:01:30,170
在下方给出了链接。其中包含一个工作流程图，可能会帮到你
which is linked below. It contains a workflow diagram that could help you.

23
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:32,820
你会发现你应该尽可能的不要让用户去“设置”些什么
Very few roads often lead to making something a setting.
