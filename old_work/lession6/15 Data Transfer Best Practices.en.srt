1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,260
你需要记住的是
The most important thing you have to remember is that

2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:05,850
每次你传输数据的时候，无论数据量多小
every time you transfer data, no matter how small, the radio

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:10,130
无线电都要运作至少半分钟
could stay powered up for nearly half a minute. So every

4
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:12,790
所以你的决策要基于
decision you make will be based on minimizing the number of

5
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:16,540
尽量减少传输的次数的原则上。当然了也有一种折衷的选择
times that this happens. But of course there's a balance here.

6
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:19,180
你想一次下载当前情况下
You want to download all the data a user is likely

7
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:21,940
用户可能需要的数据
to need for the current section in a single burst over

8
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:25,520
但是，你肯定不想把全部都下载下来
a single connection at full capacity. But of course, you don't

9
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:29,060
这样完全是浪费电量，下下来了一大堆
just want to pull down everything wasting battery power and bandwidth

10
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:31,980
可能永远用不到的数据
downloading data that's never going to be used. Now I could go

11
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:34,750
这里要是展开来我能讲一小时，不过Dan快等不及了
on for hours on this topic, but Dan's getting impatient. And

12
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:36,740
你能从他那儿学到怎样去实现上面这些关于传输优化的技能
you can learn the details on how to implement each of

13
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:39,600
包括预读取、
these best practices, including pre-fetching,

14
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,340
成批打包数据、减少你的更新频率
batching and bundling, burying your

15
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,930
和最小化载荷，通过一系列开发视频
update frequency, and minimizing your payloads by watching the series of

16
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:47,690
或者是读下面链接里的开发者指南
Dev Lite videos or reading the developer guides linked to in

17
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:50,670
现在在我将工作交给Dan
the instructor notes below. Now before I leave it to Dan

18
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:52,910
让他给你们展示怎样实现一个Sunshine的
to show you how to implement a sync adapter for

19
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:55,820
采用了一大堆我刚刚说过的最佳实践的同步adapter之前
Sunshine that takes advantage of a lot of the best practices

20
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:58,940
让我们想想如果你去开发一个App像是新闻阅读器，
I just described, let's consider what the best practice would be

21
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:01,570
什么才是最佳的实现方法
if you were building something like a news reader app. How

22
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:05,030
当这个App第一次被启动时，应该下载多少数据
much data should you download when the app is first started?

23
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:08,280
只下载主页面需要的标题、头版新闻里的所有文字和图片、
Just the front page of headlines, all the stories and images

24
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,960
所有新闻的文字（不包括图片）
linked to from that front page? Every story available, but none

25
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:15,830
还是现在可以取得的所有新闻的文字和图片？
of the images? Or every story and every image currently available?
