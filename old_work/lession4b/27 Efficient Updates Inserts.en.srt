1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,450
好了，我们已经实现了contentprovider的核心，
Well we're done with the core of our content provider,

2
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:04,990
但是仍然有一个可选的方法，它能够让代码变得
but there's still one more optional method that'll make things

3
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:09,250
更加高效。我们通过Ctrl+O开始看
much more efficient. We'll start by hitting Ctrl+O to look

4
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:11,940
我们能够重写的函数。目前显示有
at the functions we can override. It turns out there's

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:15,780
一个函数叫bulkInsert。任何以前做过
a function called bulkInsert. Anyone out there who has done

6
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:18,210
数据库工作的人知道在
database work knows that putting a bunch of inserts into

7
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:21,610
一个事务插入一堆数据经常要比一个一个插入更快。
a single transaction is usually much faster than inserting them

8
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:25,860
BulkInsert允许我们做这件事。默认的
individually. Bulk insert allows us to do just that. The default

9
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,500
实现是只多次调用insert，但是
implementation just calls insert a bunch of times, but

10
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,610
我们能够将它放在一个事务，如果我们实现
we can wrap it in a transaction if we implement

11
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:33,250
它。我们只是将在这添加
it ourselves. We're only going to add support for

12
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:36,520
天气预测事务的支持，因为只有他们是一批一起添加的。
weather forecast transactions here, since they're the only we insert

13
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:41,150
我们以调用db.beginTransaction开始。对于每个
in bulk. We start by calling db.beginTransaction. For each

14
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:44,340
传入的contentvalues，我们插入和更新插入记录的个数。
ContentValues passed in, we insert and update the number of

15
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,890
当我们做完了，我们设置事务
records inserted. When we're done, we set the transaction

16
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:50,840
成功。否则，我们的记录将不会提交
to be successful. Otherwise our records will not be committed,

17
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,020
并且将依赖最后的结束事务的语句。
and then rely on the finally statement to end the

18
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:56,500
默认情况，我们只是调用超类。
transaction. In the default case, we just call the super

19
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:00,640
记住，它做了插入，但并不是那么完美。
class. Remember, it does the insert, just not optimally. And

20
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,135
好了，这就是我们实现的bulkInsert。
that's it, that's all we have to do to implement bulkInsert.
