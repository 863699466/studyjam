为了在应用中向OpenWeatherMap请求数据，
To fetch the data from OpenWeatherMap within an

00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:05,750
首先我们需要以之前确定的URL的形式，
app, first we need to make an HTTP request to the

00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:09,150
向API发送一个HTTP请求。

00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,520
然后我们需要从输入流中以JSON字符串的形式读取响应。

00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:14,480
它还没有被解析，不过我们稍后再来了解这方面的知识。

00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,080
接下来，我们需要通过断开连接并且关闭所有输入流
about that later. Then we clean up by disconnecting the connection

00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,300
来进行清理工作。我们也记录错误日志。

由于网络处理的部分有非常多样板化的代码，
we catch. Since it's a lot of networking boiler plate code,
