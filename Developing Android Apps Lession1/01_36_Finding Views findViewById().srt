1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,440
适配器初始化完毕后我们就把它绑定到Listview
Once the adapter is initialized, let's bind it to the ListView.

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:06,006
但你会发现我们的fragment里
But you may notice that we don't have a reference to the ListView

3
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:07,272
还缺少这个ListView的引用
in our fragment.

4
00:00:07,272 --> 00:00:09,530
它只是在XML布局中定义了
It was only defined in the layout XML.

5
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:12,140
系统找到XML布局文件
The system takes and inflates layout XML files,

6
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:14,830
转换成一个完整的树状图
and turns them into a full view hierarchy

7
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:18,720
而且主activity的树状图顶端有一个根布局
with a root layout of the main activity at the very top of the view tree.

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,610
我们可以给每个视图赋予ID
We can also assign IDs to each view in the tree,

9
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:26,210
如果不需要的话也可以不赋予ID
but it's not required if you don't need a reference to an individual view.

10
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:30,630
就像这个ImageView没有指明ID也没关系
For example, this ImageView doesn't have an ID associated with it and that's okay.

11
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:34,420
在与之相关的Activity或者fragment的Java代码里
Within the Java code of the associated activity or fragment,

12
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:38,660
如果需要引用一个按钮  只要调用findViewById方法就好了
if we need a reference to the button, we can simply call findViewById,

13
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:42,530
这个方法会沿着树状图查找
which will traverse down the view hierarchy until it finds a view

14
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:45,990
找到对应ID的按钮才返回
with an ID button, and then it will return that.

15
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:50,430
类似地  我们也能在树状图中找到 
Similarly, we can traverse down the view hierarchy to find the linear layout

16
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:53,620
ID叫container的线性布局  然后返回
with the ID container, and then return that.

17
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:56,050
对于这个TextView的引用本来
We could do the same to find a reference to this TextView

18
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:58,160
也可以通过遍历树状图来查找
by traversing down the view hierarchy.

19
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,833
但注意到我们已经有了这个TextView
But you'll notice that we already have a reference to the container

20
00:01:01,833 --> 00:01:04,566
父布局的ID也就是container
which is the direct parent of this TextView.

21
00:01:04,566 --> 00:01:07,990
因此  我们调用container.findViewById
Hence, we can just call container.findViewById

22
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:12,291
就可以在这个子树里找到这个TextView的ID
to search this subtree to find the TextView with this ID,

23
00:01:12,291 --> 00:01:13,742
然后返回
and then return it.

24
00:01:13,742 --> 00:01:18,753
用这个技巧  我们就通过子树查到要找的视图
With this method, we have a smaller sub-tree to search for a given view,

25
00:01:18,753 --> 00:01:21,966
而不是去全树遍历
as opposed to searching the entire view hierarchy.

26
00:01:21,966 --> 00:01:24,530
在Android官方Java文档的View类中
In the Android Java doc for the View class,

27
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:26,516
就是下面这个链接  
which is linked below if you want to follow along,

28
00:01:26,516 --> 00:01:30,902
有一个已经在XML布局中定义的按钮的例子
it contains an example with a button with Define in Layout XML.

29
00:01:30,902 --> 00:01:33,270
它的ID是my_button
It was assigned an ID, my_button.

30
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:38,763
然后在这个Activity里我们可以使用findViewByID方法
Then, in the Activity, we can use the findViewByID method with that ID,

31
00:01:38,763 --> 00:01:41,036
来引用这个按钮
so that we can get a reference to the button.

32
00:01:41,036 --> 00:01:43,250
然后还可以动态修改
Then we can change it dynamically,

33
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:45,794
比如给它加一个点击监听器
such as by adding a click listener to it.

34
00:01:46,774 --> 00:01:50,420
那现在 PLaceholderFragment 类里将适配器绑定到ListView里
Now in the Placeholder Fragment class, bind the adapter to the ListView.

35
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:53,460
由于我们给 ListView 之前指定了ID
Luckily, we did assign an ID to the ListView earlier,

36
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,530
现在可以很容易找到了
so we can find it easily now.

37
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:58,090
记得找到树状图里的最小子树
Think about the smallest sub-tree in the view hierarchy

38
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:02,700
再去调用 findViewByID 方法  最后设置 ArrayAdapter
that you can call findViewByID on, then set the adapter on it.

39
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:06,140
如果还需要范例的话  请你查看下面的链接
If you want an example, you can see one in the link below.

40
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:08,110
完成后记得勾上这些框框
Check the boxes when you're done.
