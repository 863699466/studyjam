表面上看来，创建一个项目列表是一件很简单的事情。
On the surface, creating a list of items is simple enough.

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:06,350
Android有一个滚动的视图，你可以放一个linear布局进去
Android includes a Scroll View into which you can place any

3
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:11,740
依次排列每个元素，构成一个垂直的列表。
linear layout that in turn arranges each item it contains into a vertical list.

4
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:15,550
注意底部超出屏幕范围的项目
Note the items which have fallen off the bottom off the linear layout. And

5
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:19,630
此时它们在UI中是不可见的
therefore aren't currently visible in that UI. The Scroll View,

6
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:22,660
顾名思义，用户可以滚动这个滚动视图来看到下面的内容
as the name suggests, will let the user scroll through the contents of

7
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:26,320
然而，在内存有限的设备上使用滚动视图是个挑战，
the layout it contains. But there's a challenge associated with that approach on

8
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,160
关键是，在什么时候对用户的交互进行响应
a device with limited memory, and where touch responsiveness is

9
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,900
当你的列表中有50个列表项的话
critically important. If you have 50 items in a list and

10
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:37,250
而同一时刻屏幕上最多显示10个项目
can fit 10 items on screen at any given time. What's the minimum number of

11
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:41,150
那么在滑动屏幕的任意一时间点，你需要在内存中维持多少个列表项呢
views you'd need to create in order to scroll through every item on the list?

12
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:46,090
答案可能不是那么显而易见，想想怎样才能更有效率地
The answer might not be immediately obvious but think about ways in which you

13
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:50,270
来呈现这个列表
can be more efficient in your use of the views used to display the entire list.
