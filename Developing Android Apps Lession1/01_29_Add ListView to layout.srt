谢谢Rado
Thanks, Rado.

00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:04,740
现在我们都知道了ListView非常好用
Now that we know the distinct advantages of using a list view,

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:08,750
可以用它在应用中展示天气预报
we can use a list view to display the list of weather forecasts in our app.

4
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:13,140
那我们应该修改哪个布局文件来做到呢
Now which file in the layout folder should we modify to accomplish this?

5
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:16,530
我们需要把ListView直接放进Fragment布局
Well, we want to add the list view directly to the fragment.

6
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:19,670
你打开fragment_main.xml文件的话
If you open up the fragment_main.xml file,

7
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:22,670
你可以看到布局里有个作为父视图的RelativeLayout
you'll notice that the layout includes a RelativeLayout as a parent view,

8
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:25,096
也有个作为子视图TextView
as well as a child TextView.

9
00:00:25,096 --> 00:00:28,692
修改这个文件  用ListView代替TextView
Modify this file so that we show a ListView instead of a TextView

10
00:00:28,692 --> 00:00:33,840
并指定其ID为ListViewForecast便于我们之后引用
and assign it an ID ListViewForecast so we can reference it later.

11
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,010
既然这个布局只有一个子视图
Also, since this layout only contains one child's view,

12
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:39,840
父布局使用FrameLayout
it would be more efficient to actually switch to a FrameLayout

13
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,940
要比RelativeLayout更好
instead of a RelativeLayout.

14
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:45,020
这些都做完以后  编译运行你的应用 
After you make the changes, compile and run your app.

15
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:49,200
你会觉得黑屏怪怪的  但是没关系
You will be a little bit underwhelmed with the blank screen, but that's okay.

16
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,030
因为我们还没有给ListView填充数据
That's because we haven't populated the list view with data yet,

17
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:53,929
这会在下一步实现
and that will come in a later step.

18
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:55,559
完成了记得来检查一下
Check the box when you're done.
