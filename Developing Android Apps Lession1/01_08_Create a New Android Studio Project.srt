1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,990
一旦你安装好Android Studio，打开它
Once you install Android Studio you can open it and check for

2
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:04,570
在运行之前检查有没有升级内容
updates before proceeding.

3
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:07,096
看上去我们的版本是最新的
Looks like we have the latest version installed already, so

4
00:00:07,096 --> 00:00:08,191
所以我们关闭这个对话框
we can close this dialog.

5
00:00:08,191 --> 00:00:11,960
我们准备用Android Studio 1.01版新建一个项目
We're going to be setting up a new project using Android Studio version 1.01.

6
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:16,490
如果你发现你的版本和我的看上去不太一样
As you follow along, if things look differently on your computer, that's okay.

7
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:19,410
可能是你的Android Studio版本更新，没什么大问题
It's probably because you're on a newer version of Android Studio.

8
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:22,020
遇到任何问题请查看下面的笔记
For the most up-to-date instructions on how to get started,

9
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,260
它会实时更新
you can always check the instructor notes below.

10
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:27,240
现在，点击这里来新建一个Android Studio项目
Now, let's click here to start a new Android Studio project.

11
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,550
在项目引导页面，我们设置App的名字为Sunshine
In the project wizard, we set the app name to be Sunshine.

12
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:33,180 
然后我们需要定义一个相符的包名
Then we provide a corresponding package name.

13
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,570
包名在所有能在Android上安装的包这个范围内都应该是独一无二的，
The package name should be globally unique across all packages installed

14
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:37,540
on Android.

15
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:38,900
为了避免包名冲突
To avoid conflicts,

16
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:41,970
将你拥有的互联网域名反过来
use the reverse of the name of the internet domain that you own.

17
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:44,520
这和Java包名的命名惯例相同
This follows the Java package name conventions.

18
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,620
我们用example作为Sunshine App的包名
We're using the combat example name space for

19
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,680
因为它足够坚定
our Sunshine app because it's a sample.

20
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:52,240
但是你不能将这样包名的App发布到Google Play上去
But you cannot publish an app on Google Play with that name space.

21
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,840
通常就让它保持默认包名
Usually leaving the default package name is fine.

22
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,270
不过，这个课程用的是老版本Android Studio
However, this course was originally filmed with a older version of

23
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:03,110
默认包括模块名
Android Studio where the module name app was included by default.

24
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:04,950
所以我们在这里修改下包名
So, we'll edit the package name here, so

25
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:08,180
这样就和我们用老版本Android Studio创建的目录相符合了
it matches what we had in the older version of Android Studio.

26
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:10,920
你们也应该加上“.app”
For your code to match the rest of the code in this course,

27
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,960
这样就能和其他代码相配
you should add the dot app as well.

28
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,800
下一步，我们选择项目目录，然后点击Next
Next, we choose our project location and then we can hit Next.

29
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,400
现在我们需要选择最小SDK版本
Now we need to choose our minimum SDK version.

30
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,940
在之前版本的Android Studio
In previous versions of Android Studio,

31
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:24,070
你还要选择一个目标SDK
you would also have to select the target SDK.

32
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:27,230
现在的话，项目引导自动设置目标SDK
Now the project wizard automatically sets the target SDK

33
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:29,590
为最新版本的Android
to the latest version of Android.

34
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:30,850
不过了解到最小SDK和目标SDK的差别仍然很重要
Even though it's already selected for

35
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:34,480
即使已经为你选好了
you, it's important to know the distinction between minimum and target SDK.
