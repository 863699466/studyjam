1
00:00:00,808 --> 00:00:02,718
现在  在Android Studio里  你可以点击运行按钮
Now in Android studio, you can hit the play button

2
00:00:02,718 --> 00:00:04,899
在手机上运行应用
to run the app on your device.

3
00:00:04,899 --> 00:00:07,949
在设备选择对话框中  可看到与电脑相连的移动设备
In the device Chooser dialog, you should see your connected device.

4
00:00:08,402 --> 00:00:12,095
要想在之后的运行时不弹出该对话框  选中这个复选框即可
To prevent the dialog from popping up in future times, check this box,

5
00:00:12,384 --> 00:00:15,337
点击OK按钮  稍等片刻
and then hit OK to continue. Within a few moments,

6
00:00:15,337 --> 00:00:17,464
就可以看到Sunshine已经在手机上跑起来了
you should see it on your phone.

7
00:00:17,464 --> 00:00:19,325
另外  Raido也提到过 
On the other hand, as Raido was mentioning,

8
00:00:19,325 --> 00:00:21,416
你还可以使用命令行工具
you can use command line tools.

9
00:00:21,416 --> 00:00:24,945
在项目的根目录下  用gradlew命令在Mac或者Linux平台上
From the root folder of the project, use grade lw to build your app

10
00:00:24,945 --> 00:00:26,366
来构建你的应用
on Mac or Linux.

11
00:00:26,366 --> 00:00:28,740
如果你使用Windows系统  请查看视频下方笔记中的链接
Check the link in the notes below if you're using Windows.

12
00:00:29,704 --> 00:00:32,734
第一行命令使gradle wrapper脚本命令获取到权限
This first command grants execution permission

13
00:00:32,734 --> 00:00:34,943
这条命令只需要执行一次
to the gradlw rappers script. And you only need to do it the first time

14
00:00:34,943 --> 00:00:37,450
以后在命令行中构建应用时就不需要再执行了
you're trying to build from the command line.

15
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:42,078
执行./gradlew assembleDebug命令可调试程序  在应用构建成功之后
Then you can call grade lw assemble debug. Once the build is successful,

16
00:00:42,078 --> 00:00:47,090
在app/build/apk路径下会生成一个apk文件
it creates an APK file at the app/build/apk directory.

17
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:50,788
可使用adb命令进行安装apk
You can use adb to install the app. The -r command means

18
00:00:50,788 --> 00:00:52,520
-r参数表明若应用已存在
that you can replace an existing version

19
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,547
则进行覆盖安装
of the app if you've already done it before.

20
00:00:55,547 --> 00:00:58,694
有关adb命令使用的更多技巧  请看下方的教学笔记（Instructor Notes）
For more tips on adb, you can see the instructor notes below.

21
00:00:59,012 --> 00:01:02,255
你可以使用adb shell am命令启动MainActivity
Then you can use this adb command with the activity manager tool

22
00:01:02,255 --> 00:01:07,494
手机屏幕上也会立刻显示本次执行的结果
in order to start the main activity. And there you see it on the device.

23
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:10,163
我们看到应用已经能够在手机上运行起来了
And now we see it running in our phones.

24
00:01:10,353 --> 00:01:11,870
Woo hoo  来碰个拳头~
Woo hoo! Fist bump!

25
00:01:13,219 --> 00:01:19,746
目前进展一切顺利  让我们去找Dan来设计sunshine的UI界面吧  Woo~~
We're on a roll. Let's go find Dan so that we can build up the sunshine UI. Woo!
