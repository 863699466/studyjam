1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,670
一旦Adapter被初始化  让我们把它绑定到ListView上
Once the adapter is initialized, let's bind it to the list view. But

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:06,980
但是我们还没有ListView的引用
you may notice that we don't have a reference to the list view in our fragment.

3
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:10,360
只是把它定义在了布局XML中
It was only defined in the layout XML. The system takes and

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,370
系统会实现XML中的布局
inflates layout XML files. And

5
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:17,000
并将它们转换成一个倒树状的结构
turns them into a full view hierarchy with a root layout of the main activity at

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,750
Main Activity在树顶（或者说树根） 我们可以给树上的每个View设一个ID
the very top of the view tree. We can also assign IDs to each view in the tree,

7
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:26,320
不过你用不到的View可以不给它设
but it's not required if you don't need a reference to an individual view.

8
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,790
例如 这个图像View没有ID完全没问题
For example, this image view doesn't have an ID associated with it and

9
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:33,640
在Java代码中对应的Activity或Fragment中
that's okay. Within the Java code of the associated activity or

10
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:38,660
如果我们需要这个按钮的引用 可以调用findViewById
fragment. If we need a reference to the button, we can simply call findViewById,

11
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:43,370
它会一直向下遍历这个树直到它找到有这个ID的按钮
which will traverse down the hierarchy until it finds a view with the ID button.

12
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:48,050
然后会返回它 同样 我们可以遍历
And then it will return that. Similarly, we can traverse down the view

13
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:53,620
去用ID找LinearLayout这个容器
hierarchy to find the linear layout with the ID container, and then return that.

14
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:57,030
同样的 可以用ID来找这个TextView
We could do the same to find a reference to this TextView by traversing down

15
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:00,830
但是想必你已经注意到了 它的父元素容器的引用我们已经有了
the view hierarchy. But you'll notice that we already have a reference to

16
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:06,055
所以我们能直接对父元素调用findViewById
the container which is a direct parent of this TextView. Hence, we can just call

17
00:01:06,055 --> 00:01:12,420
然后用ID找到它对应的子元素
container.findViewById to search this subtree to find the TextView with this ID,

18
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:17,480
然后返回它  使用这个方法  我们要搜索的树
and then return it. With this method, we have a smaller sub-tree to search for

19
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:22,060
比起整个书更小
a given view, as opposed to searching the entire view hierarchy.

20
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:25,890
在Android Java文档中对于View这个类的说明（下面有链接）
In the Android Java doc for the View class, which is linked below if you want to

21
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:30,020
这里有个XML中定义好的按钮
follow along, it contains an example where the button with Define in Layout XML.

22
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:36,350
ID是my_button  在Activity当中
It was assigned an ID My Button. Then in the Activity, we can use the find

23
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:40,990
我们可以使用ID查找这个View  得到按钮的应用
view by ID method, with that ID, so that we can get a reference to the button.

24
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:45,510
然后我们可以动态地修改按钮 例如给它加一个监听器
Then we can change it dynamically, such as by adding a click listener to it.

25
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:50,560
在PlaceholderFragment.class中 将Adapter与ListView绑定
Now in the placeholder fragment class, bind the adapter to the list view.

26
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,230
幸运的是  我们已经给ListView分配了一个ID  所以很容易找到它
Luckily, we did assign an ID to the list view earlier. So, we can find it

27
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:58,430
使用最小的树来遍历找到它
easily now. Think about the smallest sub-tree in the view hierarchy that you

28
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:03,640
然后给它设一个Adapter 如果你想要点提示
can call find view by ID on. Then set the adapter on it. If you want an example,

29
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:07,430
