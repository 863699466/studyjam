1
00:00:00,037 --> 00:00:04,190
感谢Veto告诉我们选择合适的版本的重要性
Thanks for telling us about the
importance of proper dessert selection.

2
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:06,290
让我们来选择一个甜点吧
So let's choose our desserts now.

3
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:09,830
我们App支持的最早的版本是Gingerbread
The earliest platform version that
our Apple support is Gingerbread.

4
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:12,860
目前来说，选择Gingerbread意味着
At the current time, choosing
Gingerbread means we can cover over 99%

5
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:16,070
在Google Play Store激活的设备范围内我们可以覆盖99%的设备
of the devices active
on Google Playstore.

6
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:19,690
这也是能不能使用Google Play Services例如
It's also the cutoff for using Google
Play services for things like maps and

7
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:22,540
maps, location和 Android support library的分水岭
location and
the Android support library.

8
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:26,400
support library包提供了对于之后版本的UI新特性的支持
The support library package offers an
implementation of ui features that were

9
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,400
added in later releases of Android but

10
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,750
可以在老版本上使用新版本的UI
now can be used on older
versions of the platform.

11
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,040
所以很有用
So it's really useful.

12
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,825
我们选择了API 10的Gingerbread
Notice how we picked the latest
version of Gingerbread with API level

13
00:00:34,825 --> 00:00:39,220
因为它相对于API 9修复了一些bug
10 because it contains additional bug
fixes that API level 9 doesn't have.

14
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:41,320
然后点击Next
The we can go ahead and click Next.

15
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,340
选择一个模板，我们选择Blank Activity with Fragment
We're going to choose the template,
Blank Activity with Fragment.

16
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,580
有一个Activity作为UI的呈现容器
For background context and
activity serves as the present layer for

17
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:51,890
上面一个Fragment占据部分屏幕来呈现内容
our UI, and a fragment represents
a behavior or portion of the screen.

18
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:54,995
我们可以修改引导为我们自动生成的文件名
And now we have an option to modify
the names of the files that will be

19
00:00:54,995 --> 00:00:56,770
auto-generated from the wizard.

20
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:59,210
我们的Activity名是MainActivity
The name of our activity
is MainActivity, and

21
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:03,720
它的布局由activity_main所定义的，这是一个XML文件
the layout will come from activity_main,
which is an XML file.

22
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:07,730
同样的，Fragment的布局来自fragment_main
In a similar fashion, the fragments
layout will come from fragment_main,

23
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:09,130
也是一个XML文件
which is also an XML file.

24
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:13,525
在这里我修改下文件名为main.xml
I'm going to do a small change for
the name of the menu file to be called

25
00:01:13,525 --> 00:01:18,220
因为老版本的Android Studio的默认名是这个
main.xml because on a older version of
Android's tu, that was the default name.

26
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:19,640
然后点击Finish
Then we go ahead and hit Finish.

27
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,960
现在你应该有一个新创建的Sunshine App
And now you should have a newly
created sunshine app with the files on

28
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,060
文件目录在左边
the left here.

29
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,540
默认情况下，你看到的文件是基于Android视图
By default, you may see
the Android view of the files,

30
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,510
是一个平面式的项目结构
which is a flattened version
of the project structure,

31
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:31,890
并且它高亮了你需要编辑的Android源代码文件
and it highlights the key Android
source files that you'll need to edit.

32
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:35,030
在这个课程里，我们使用这个项目视图
In this course, though, we're going to
be using the project view because that's

33
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:37,145
因为老版本中我们也是用的这个
what we had in the older
version of Android Studio.

34
00:01:37,145 --> 00:01:39,405
你也可以选择你喜欢的视图
You can choose any view that you prefer,
though.

35
00:01:39,405 --> 00:01:41,875
确保Gradle的编译完成了
Make sure you wait for
the gradle build to finish.

36
00:01:41,875 --> 00:01:44,895
如果你有任何问题，可以去查看引导文档或者下面的笔记
If you have any errors, you can check
the guide and instructor notes below.

37
00:01:44,895 --> 00:01:47,125
提示下，你还可以看下在App文件夹中的
As a tip,
you can check the build.gradle file,

38
00:01:47,125 --> 00:01:49,795
build.gradle文件
which is located under the App folder.

39
00:01:49,795 --> 00:01:52,235
你需要确保compileSdkVersion和
You want to make sure that
the compileSdkVersion and

40
00:01:52,235 --> 00:01:55,975
targetSdkVersion都指向最新的稳定版本
the targetSdkVersion are both pointing
at the latest stable version of

41
00:01:55,975 --> 00:01:57,365
the platform.

42
00:01:57,365 --> 00:02:01,510
这里，最新版本是API 21也就是Android 5.0 Lollipop
In this case, it's 21 for
the Android 5.0 Lollipop release.

43
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:04,720
一旦编译好了，我们可以添加更适合我们的天气App的
Once it's done building, we can add a
custom app icon that's more fitting for

44
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,290
自定义的App图标
our weather app.

45
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:09,310
右击App文件夹单击新建Image Asset
Right-click on the App folder and
click New Image Asset.

46
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:12,680
你可以改变这些选项
You can choose from any of
the clip art options or

47
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,980
可以用下面我们提供的图片
you can use the one that we
provide in the download below.

48
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:19,540
用这个占位图标
Then, use a placeholder icon we
provide in a download below.

49
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:22,010
现在App会显示这个图标
Now this will show up in
the All Apps screen, so

50
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:24,790
点击这个图标会打开我们的App
that clicking on this app
icon will launch our app.

51
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:28,280
如果Sunshine是你最近使用的App
It will also show up in the overview
space if sunshine is one of

52
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,950
这个图标也会显示在多任务切换界面中
your most recent tasks.

53
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:34,380
还可以在我们App的Action Bar中看到这个图标
The other place you might see this app
icon is in the action bar of our app.

54
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:38,420
在这个课程的视频中，我们使用的是之前的
In certain videos of this course that
were filmed earlier on Kit Kat by

55
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:42,560
Kit Kat版本，默认是在Action Bar中有显示App图标
default the action bar
shows the app icon.

56
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,570
而在Material Design的Lollipop和之后的版本中
With material design on Lollipop and
later, the app icon doesn't show up

57
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:49,500
App图标默认不会显示，所以如果没看到它不需要担心
by default anymore, so
don't worry if you don't see it.

58
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,230
It's fine, and

59
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:53,330
我们将会在课程5中自定义Action Bar
we're going to be styling the action
bar later in lesson five, anyways.
