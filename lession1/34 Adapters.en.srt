1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,730
我们有了测试数据之后怎么让它显示到ListView视图上呢
Given some sample data how do we populate a ListView?

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:07,370
我们来用一套联系人的测试数据来看看它们如何显示到列表里
Let's look at an example of some contact data and how it can be displayed in

3
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:12,140
我们来看看我们这三个联系人的原始数据
the list. We start with our raw data of contacts which is three contacts,

4
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:16,720
三个人的名字和他们的头像照片  然后我们就把这些数据通过Adapter适配器初始化
as well as our profile images. Then we pass this data into the adapter so

5
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:21,730
随后我们就可以调用它了  Adapter适配器知道如何为这些数据条目生成
it has a reference to it. The adapter also knows how to build a list item layout

6
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:26,500
合适的布局元素  所以它就可以为这些数据创建布局元素了
for each of these data items. So, it could go ahead and create the layouts for

7
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:31,160
直到ListView视图需要的时候  我们才会把这些数据呈现给它
them. But we don't need to create the views yet until the ListView requests that

8
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:35,290
例如  你有上百号联系人
it needs them. For example, if you had hundreds of contacts here,

9
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:40,740
你并不需要为用不到的人搞那么多座位在你身旁
you wouldn't want hundreds of layouts sitting around that aren't being used.

10
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:42,850
然后把Adapter适配器绑定到ListView视图之后
Then when you bind the adapter to the ListView,

11
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:46,710
ListView视图会自己决定要多少个条目的
the ListView will ask how many items are actually in the data set.

12
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:50,520
因此这个Adapter适配器就会检查一下数据源  这里有三条数据
And the adapter will check in the data set there's three items, so

13
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,960
然后把三条数据告诉ListView视图 ListView视图就知道了他总共
we will return that to the ListView. Now the ListView knows that it will have to

14
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:59,395
要呈现三条数据  现在ListView视图会从零位开始
populate itself with three list items. Now the ListView starts at position

15
00:00:59,395 --> 00:01:04,170
去找在第零位元素的布局信息
zero and asks for the list item layout located at that position. It goes back to

16
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:09,520
随之它去向Adapter适配器找第0位的数据信息  我们找到了
the adapter and the adapter checks that at position zero, we have the contact,

17
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:15,140
是Anna这个联系人  Adapter适配器知道如何如何为Anna创建一个列表元素布局
Anna. The adapter knows how to create a list item layout from the contact, Anna.

18
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:20,360
所以它就这么做了  然后就会把内容返回到LisView视图去
So, it goes ahead and does that. And then we return it to the ListView. And now

19
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:24,027
现在我们就看到了Anna这个列表项就在这个列表里的第零位
we see that the Anna list item is located at the zeroth position in the list.

20
00:01:24,027 --> 00:01:29,270
随后ListView视图会去检查在第一个条目位置的内容
Next the ListView wants to get the item at position one, so

21
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:34,340
去找Adapter适配器要布局信息  然后它检查了一下第一个位置的内容
ask for the layout from the adapter. The adapter checks that at position one,

22
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:39,110
我们找到了Bob这个联系人  Adapter适配器知道如何如何为Bob创建一个列表元素布局
we have the contact Bob. The adapter knows how to create a list item layout for

23
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:43,990
所以它就这么做了  然后就会把内容返回到LisView视图去
Bob so it goes ahead and does that and then it returns it to the ListView. And

24
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:47,660
现在我们看到列表项Bob已经成功的添加到了ListView视图里了
now we see that the list item for Bob has been successfully added

25
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:51,010
它在第一个位置  然后ListView视图去得到最后一个条目
to the ListView at position one. Now, the ListView fetches its

26
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:55,740
因为它知道整个列表里总共只有三个条目
last item because it knows that there was three list items to expect.

27
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:01,280
它请求Adapter适配器  获取到第二个位置的条目布局信息
It fetches the last list item layout at position two by asking the adapter.

28
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,890
Adapter适配器就去检查了第二个位置的内容  找到了Charlie  包含她的头像一起
The adapter checks that at position two, we have Charlie, as well as that image.

29
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:10,810
然后Adapter适配器知道如何如何为Charlie创建一个列表元素布局
And we know how to make a list item layout for Charlie, so we can go ahead and

30
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:15,010
返回给ListView视图之后  Charlie这个联系人条目也就显示到ListView视图里了
do that, and return it to the ListView. And now we have the list item for

31
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:19,180
现在 我们已经完成了我们这个列表啦
Charlie and position two in the list. And we have our complete list
