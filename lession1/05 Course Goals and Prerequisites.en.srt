1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:03,430
大家要知道  我们并不是在教你如何
Now, it's important to remember that we're not here to teach you how to

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:04,950
做一个天气应用
build a weather app.

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:08,562
不是在教你我们做这个程序所用到的API
It's not even to teach you all the Android
APIs that we use to build it.

4
00:00:08,562 --> 00:00:13,852
而是在锻炼你的大脑  让你像一个移动应用开发者一样思考
It's really about retraining your brain to start thinking like a mobile developer,

5
00:00:13,852 --> 00:00:18,995
思考方式真的很重要  因为我们在课程结束的时候会要求你自己
which is really important, because at the end of this course we're gonna ask you to

6
00:00:18,995 --> 00:00:20,924
做一个项目
build your own final project.

7
00:00:20,924 --> 00:00:26,452
[NOISE].

8
00:00:26,452 --> 00:00:30,939
这里我希望你已经理会面向对象编程的思想
We're expecting you to already be familiar with object-oriented programming, and

9
00:00:30,939 --> 00:00:33,649
并且有Java等类似语言基础
to have experience with Java or a similar language.

10
00:00:33,649 --> 00:00:37,570
就我个人而言  我在做了几年的Delphi和C＃之后转做Android开发
Personally, I got started with Android after years of Delphi and C# development.

11
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,560
作为工程师  我们一般都会把当前的经验应用到一门新的开发语言
As engineers, we're trained to map our experiences in one language or

12
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,310
或者SDK
SDK into new ones.

13
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:48,620
找出他们之间相似的模式可以让我们以最快的速度入门
Looking for patterns and shortcuts we can get up to speed as quickly as possible.

14
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:50,750
但是移动开发者  尤其是Android开发者
But mobile, and Android in particular,

15
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:54,220
从本质上说跟普通开发者还是有不同的  也即是说一些既定的经验
have some fundamental differences that mean some of our experience and

16
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:58,310
和直觉极有可能让你变成一个不称职的移动开发者
intuition will actually make us worse mobile engineers.

17
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:02,370
我们习惯性的把智能手机认为是缩小版的电脑
We like to think of Smartphones as computers that fit into our pockets.

18
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:06,240
从某种意义上这本无异议  但是电脑是来自90年代的东东
In a way that's true, but the computers from the 90s,

19
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,260
就像20年前我用的这个Powerhouse一样
like this Powerhouse I was using nearly 20 years ago.

20
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:12,660
它网速超级慢  CPU处理速度也慢
With limited internet connectivity, low speed CPUs, and

21
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:16,600
内存也小的可怜  除此之外  这些东西全部需要电源供电
limited RAM, on top of which, they're all running on batteries.

22
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,910
在我们的课程里
As we go through the course,

23
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:20,990
我们将在移动开发上重新面临这些问题
I'll be returning to each of these key mobile challenges.

24
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:23,160
你在桌面环境开发  服务器端
Looking for places where you're experienced on desktop or

25
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:26,420
或者其他移动平台上的开发经验很可能把你带到坑口去
server, or even other mobile platforms might lead you in the wrong direction.

26
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:30,790
同样的  我会跟你分享一些早期Android系统的故事
I will also be back to tell you some stories from the early days of Android.

27
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:34,560
一些描述Android系统是如何迭代更新的故事
Stories that describe how the Android platform has evolved.

28
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,230
我在的这个地方  就是最具代表性的
And nowhere is that more readily apparent than here,

29
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:39,830
Android Lawn雕塑园
at the Android Lawn sculpture garden.

30
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:42,620
在这个Android的中心  我邀请你加入我们的课程  在课程结束的时候
Join me here, at the very heart of Android, at the end of this lesson,

31
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:45,680
就能知道这些雕塑的代表着什么
to find out how this sculpture garden of tasty treats,

32
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,590
也可以从中知道Android的历史
also tell us the story of Android's history.

33
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:50,840
现在开始  我们回到做天气应用的话题
For now, let's get back to building that weather app.

34
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,790
我们邀请Dan来开讲
So, we'll cross to Dan, to take a look at some mocks.
