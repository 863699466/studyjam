1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:01,340
Okay.

2
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:03,350
Now for the big quiz.

3
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:06,990
Implement the details view
using a CursorLoader.

4
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:10,240
We've just implemented a CursorLoader
for forecast fragment.

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,240
So if you're unsure where to start,
start with the same steps we used for

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,940
forecast fragment.

7
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:17,980
You can use the same
utility functions and

8
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:21,090
even the same format that we
used in forecast fragment

9
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:24,840
to help you format the string that
you will set into the detail view.

10
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,410
Consider taking
advantage of projections.

11
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:31,480
The trickiest part of all this is
making sure that your sharing function

12
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,860
is still working when you're all done.

13
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:35,543
But don't worry too much about that.

14
00:00:35,543 --> 00:00:39,873
The important thing is to
understand how CursorLoaders work.

15
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:43,623
Look at the solution if you really
want to see how sharing is done.

16
00:00:43,623 --> 00:00:46,394
If you're at all confused
about how sharing is done,

17
00:00:46,394 --> 00:00:47,819
just look at the solution.
