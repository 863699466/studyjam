1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:01,710
恩 你已经完成了
Alright, you're done!

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,540
我们看一下解决方案
Let's take a look at the solution.

3
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:07,200
对于天气(content provider)我们仅仅获得一个可读的数据库和
For weather,
we just get a readable database and

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,040
传递请求content provider来的所有参数
pass all of these parameters
from the content provider call.

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,000
天气和位置的实现方法是相当类似的
The solution for weather and
location is pretty much the same.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,810
对于每一个 我们传递从content provider来的参数
For each one, we're going to pass the
parameters that come through the content

7
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:22,380
到可读的数据库中的查询方法
provider into the query function
of our readable database.

8
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,860
再次提醒 这些参数是从content provider中来的
Again, these are the parameters that
come through the content provider, and

9
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:29,630
这些参数的我们要传递给数据库的
these are the parameters that
we pass into the database.

10
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:31,330
位置(的content provider)看起来是类似的
Location looks approximately the same.
