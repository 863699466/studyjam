1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,203
好，现在该你动手了
All right.
Now it's your turn.

2
00:00:02,203 --> 00:00:06,656
在CursorLoader和ForecastAdapter中使用projection
Use a projection in your implementation
of the CursorLoader and ForecastAdapter

3
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:10,653
来让代码更有效率
to make your code a bit more efficient
in its use of the content provider and

4
00:00:10,653 --> 00:00:11,312
database.

5
00:00:11,312 --> 00:00:12,955
在ForecastAdapter里面
In the ForecastAdapter,

6
00:00:12,955 --> 00:00:17,870
你要修改convertCursorRowToUXFormat()函数
you'll be modifying the convert
cursor row to UX format function.

7
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:21,819
因为我们之后的教学要用到这个projection
Because our code will be making use of
this projection in future sessions,

8
00:00:21,819 --> 00:00:24,980
所以我们已经为你做好了第一步和第二步
we've done step one and
step two for you.

9
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:27,550
查看下面的笔记
See the instructor notes for
the string array you should use for

10
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:30,620
把它们用在你的代码中
our projection and the constants for
the column indices.

11
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:33,770
注意，比起现在UI中用到的数据，我们获取了更多点的数据
Note that we get more data than
we are using in the UI right now.
