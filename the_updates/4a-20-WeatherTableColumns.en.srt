1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,340
现在我们重新回顾一下我们的最终细节框架
This is a good time to revisit
our final detail wireframe.

2
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:07,550
如果我们要在数据库中保存我们的天气预报信息
If we're going to store our weather
forecast information in a database

3
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:10,270
哪一些信息行是我们所需要的呢？
table, which columns
should our contract have?

4
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:16,360
在我们的数据库中，我们有天气预报的列表
In our database, we will have
a table of weather forecast entries.

5
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,880
我们用一行代表预测的某天
We use a row to represent
each forecast day.

6
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,520
并会把与预报相关的每一项数据保存在
And we'll store each piece of data
associated with the forecast in

7
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:22,750
一个单独的列中
a separate column.

8
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:26,345
看一下我们这个天气应用的界面，
which columns would we need for

9
00:00:26,345 --> 00:00:28,100
哪一列才是我们的数据库表所需要的呢？
Taking a look at our weather UX,
the weather database table?

10
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,830
思考一下哪一列才是需要在数据库中被记录的
Think of which columns should
be in each database record.
