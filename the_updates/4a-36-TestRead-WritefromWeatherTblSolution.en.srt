00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,530
Let's look at our solution for reading
and writing from the Weather Table.

2
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:06,400
First, we take advantage of
testLocationTable returning

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:09,140
the locationRowId to save
us a bit of drudgery.

4
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:14,420
But we assert just in case that function
didn't set the return value correctly.

5
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:19,460
We then follow the same steps we did
last time, except we create the weather

6
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:24,020
values with the locationRowId
we got from the location insert.

7
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:28,290
We then insert the record,
query to get our cursor,

8
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:32,030
validate our cursor,
and close the database.

9
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:35,220
Now, let's run those tests again,
and they pass.

10
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:37,750
Our database tests are done.
