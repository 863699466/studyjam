1
00:00:00,496 --> 00:00:03,930
In the ForecastAdapter bindView method,
we have to traverse

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:07,480
the view hierarchy to find the views
in order to set data onto them.

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:08,890
If it's a recycled view,

4
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:12,450
meaning it's been used in the list
previously to display other data,

5
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:16,129
we still have to traverse the view
hierarchy to find all the views.

6
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:18,930
To remove unnecessary
findViewById calls,

7
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:20,810
we can use the View Holder Pattern.

8
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:23,290
For a list item layout that
contains different views,

9
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:25,270
we can create a View Holder object.

10
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:28,740
It contains member variables that
reference each View in the layout.

11
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,250
The View Holder object is stored
in the tag field of the View.

12
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,330
The next time that
the View is recycled and

13
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:38,800
used again, we can just immediately
set the data on to these fields.

14
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,940
You don't have to go
find all the views again.

15
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:42,600
This is our ViewHolder class.

16
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,680
You can name it anything you want.

17
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,250
It's just a Java class.

18
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:49,090
Given the list item layout,
we do all the findViewById calls.

19
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:51,778
That way we can hold references
to all the child views.

20
00:00:51,778 --> 00:00:54,800
In the newView method after
we've inflated the view,

21
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,620
we create a new viewHolder
object from that view.

22
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:00,190
Then we set that viewHolder
as the tag of the view.

23
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:02,260
The tag can be used to store any object.

24
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:04,361
But don't abuse it because
when you read it back you,

25
00:01:04,361 --> 00:01:05,866
have to know what you stored in there.

26
00:01:07,435 --> 00:01:09,363
Then in the adaptor bindView call,

27
00:01:09,363 --> 00:01:13,170
we read from the tag to get
back the viewHolder object.

28
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:16,300
Now we immediately have references to
all the individual views that we need to

29
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:20,040
update, such as icon view, date view,
description view and so on.
