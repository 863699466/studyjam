00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,780
但是它们已经成为一个强大的标准化的捷径

5
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,340
来用更轻量级的操作方式直接和应用交互

13
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:42,252
输送及时的信息，通知机制的易用是明显的

当Android利用Android Wear扩展到可穿戴设备的时候
to use, when Android expanded in to wearables with

00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,040
那些你为手机和平板电脑设计的丰富的通知

00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:51,240
突然就对可穿戴设备兼容了,而且免费。
