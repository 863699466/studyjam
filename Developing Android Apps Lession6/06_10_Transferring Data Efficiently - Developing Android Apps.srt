1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,510
通常当我们谈论数据传输效率的时候，我们总是在谈论
Typically when we talk about data transfer efficiency, we're talking

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:06,590
限制数据的传输。它降低了带宽
about limiting the amount of data being transferred. That reduces

3
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:08,990
还有成本，这很正常的一种思路。
the bandwidth and the cost and is generally a pretty

4
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:13,020
但是在移动设备上那是一个额外因素。当你看到时，
good idea. But on mobile there's an extra factor. As you

5
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:15,500
事实证明，移动网络接收模块是
can see, it turns out that the cell radio is

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,430
设备中最耗电的硬件之一的。所以
one of the biggest battery drainers on the device. So making

7
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:21,840
让你的数据传输更高效。到头来解决方案就是提高电池的寿命。
your data transfers more efficient. Will also result in improved

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,430
现在，要是程序运行更高效
battery life. Now, the basic level being more efficient means spending

9
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:29,320
就意味着花更少的时间传输数据，减少你的负载，更少的更新
less time transferring less data, reducing your payloads, and updating

10
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,560
通常可以给你省下一些资源。
less often can take you some of the way there,

11
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,650
但是那又如何？时间上能有什么区别？
but then what? Can timing make a difference? It turns

12
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:36,890
事实证明可以，这个地方我想把他
out that it can, and it's a situation I like

13
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:39,700
看做"饼干与安卓"问题。
to think of as the cookie Droid conundrum. Do we

14
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:44,190
我们是否真的用了更大的有效负载来完成更少的下载？或者我们
perform fewer downloads with larger payloads? Or do we perform

15
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:46,830
是否在恰当的时机用了大量较小的数据传输操作？
lots of small transfers just in time for when we

16
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:50,000
一个巨大的饼干还是许多小的饼干？
need them? One big cookie or lots of little cookies?

17
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,750
所以，你是怎样认为的呢？
So, what do you think? Should we have

18
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:55,620
我们是应该用少量的大饼干表示的庞大下载呢？
a smaller number of large downloads illustrated by

19
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,870
还是用大量的小饼干
this big cookie? Or a large number of

20
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:01,880
表示的小的下载呢？
small downloads, as illustrated by lots of little cookies.
